 and now ill turn the call over to sundar thank you jim and hello everyone we are holding our call from london today its an important hub for us and im excited to spend time with the local teams including google deepmind as well as leaders and partners from across the region this quarter we shared great progress at io brandcast and google marketing live and we are looking forward to cloud next in august the momentum
 across the company drove our results this quarter we delivered solid performance in search and youtube and ongoing strong growth in cloud where we remain focused on longterm value creation and we continue our important work to operate more efficiently creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities today ill talk about this momentum including our continued leadership in ai and our excitement about the
 of se we shared how we are making ai helpful for everyone in four important ways first improving knowledge and ai first company and soon gemini which we are building to be ad
 an opportunity to reimagine many of our products including our most important product search we are in a period of incredible innovation for search which is continuously over the years this quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the search generative experience or natural and intuitive user feedback has been very positive so far it can better answer the query
 people come to us with today while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that search can answer for example we found that generative ai can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferenceces before making a purchase or booking a trip we see this new experience is another jumping of point for exploring the web enabling users to go deeper to learn about
 topic im proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress since the may launch weve boosted serving efficiency reducing the time it takes to generate ai snapshots by half will deliver even faster responses over time we are engaging with the broady ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that send valuable traffic and support a healthy open web ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience
 many of these new queries are inherently commercial in nature we have more than 20 years of experience serving ads relevant to us commercial queries and sg enhances our ability to do this even better we are testing and evolving placements and formats and giving advertisers tools to take advantage of generative ai philip will talk more about how we are using generative ai in our ads products to better serve both advertises and users
 second we are helping people use ai to boost their creativity and productivity one example is b or experiment in conversational ai
 since launching in march it continues to get better we rolled out a number of exciting features and capabilities earlier this month b is now available in most of the world and over 40 of the most widely spoken languages we also added google lens capabilities so you can take an image and ask all kinds of questions turn it into code and more this new feature has been really popular and its been great to see people sharing their experiences
 bot can now read its responses aloud and you can adjust them for tone and style we continue to see great interest in using board for coding tasks on productivity earlier this year we introduce duit ai in both google cloud and workspace it helps people collaborate with ai to code write and get better insights from data and more today more than 750,000 workspace users have access to the new features in preview
 third were making it easier for others to innovate using ai one way is by providing google clouds high performance infrastructure optimized for a range of generative ai models its being used by thousands of customers and partners to transform their businesses ill give an update on the cloud business in just a moment finally we are making sure we develop and deploy ai technology responsibly so that everyone can benefit
 last week we signed on to joint commitments with other leading ai companies at the white house building on the principles that have guided our work for many years to take advantage of the ai opportunities ahead weve been sharpening our focus as a company investing responsibly with great discipline and finding areas where we can operate more cost effectively weve made good progress in data center machine efficiency which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in ai
 we continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities this quarter we reallocated a number of teams including aligning wases at sales with our existing business organization we are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud products like bard and sg are being built by small fast moving teams that have been reallocated to these high priority
 efforts overall we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the company and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs next google cloud we see continued growth with q2 revenue of $8 billion up 28 and operating profit of $395 million our ai optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generated with
 ai models more than 70 of j unicorns are google cloud customers including cohere jasper typef and many more we provide the widest choice of ai super computer options with google tpus and advanced nvidia gpus and recently launched new a3 ai supercuters h1 this enables customer
 nearly two times better price performance than industry alternatives our new generative ai offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers we are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models including third party and popular open source in our verdx search and conversational ai platforms with the number of customers growing more than 15x from april to june among them
 priceline is improving trip planning capabilities car 4 is creating full marketing campaigns in a matter of minutes and cap gemini is building hundreds of use cases to streamline time consuming business processes our new antimoney laundering ai helps banks like hsbc identify financial crime risk under new ai power target and lead identification suite is being applied at cerabel to help
 enable drug discovery our generative ai capabilities also give us an opportunity to win new customers and upsell into our install base of 9 million paying google workspace customers i mentioned devot ai earlier instacard is using it to improve customer service workfows and companies like exten are scaling sales outreach and optimizing customer service customers confidently choose
 workspace because of the safety and security we provide the distributed workforces our ai capabilities are helping us differentiate core products like cyber security
 we have integrated ai throughout our portfolio winning organizations like fizer who are using google cloud to transform their security operations chronical security operations suite with mandy and fully integrated is helping customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle in the first half of 2023 we saw 35 increase in incident response engagements compared to the same period last year
 finally our ai capabilities are also expanding our partner ecosystem with hundreds of isvs and sas providers such as box salesfce and snorkle and the worlds largest consulting firms like accenture and delo theyve collectively committed to train more than 150,000 people on google cloud generative ai turning next to youtube earlier this year we shared that revenues are
 across youtube products were nearly 40 billion for the 12 months ending in march im really pleased with how youtube is growing audiences and driving increased engagement youtube shots are now watched by over 2 billion logged in users every month up from 1.5 billion just one year ago the living room remained a fastest growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time we are reaching more than 150 million people on connected tv screens in the us
 and seeing growth in momentum internationally and on subscriptions theres good growth late last year we announced over 80 million youtube music and premium subscribers signups for nfl sunday ticket kicked off in april and we look forward to hosting our first football season on youtube this fall finally hardware and android pixel continues to have strong sales momentum we introduce new pixel devices at io
 including pixel f pixel tablet and pixel 7a and weve had a great response android 14  latest will incorporate our advances in generative ai the pixel and android teams are working together to advance the latest devices the pixel fold is a great example and software innovations before i close you may have seen that we just announce some exci
 news that ruth is taking on the important new role of president and chief investment officer as our longest serving cfo she has helped guide the company through an amazing period of growth a global pandemic and the ongoing economic uncertainity that has followed im excited to continue to work with ruth who will lead our 2024 planning and remain a cfo while we do a full search for a successor so its business as usual now and no change in approach for the future
 i look forward to seeing the impact ruth will have in a new role driving our investments engaging with our stakeholders and creating opportunities for people and communities everywhere to close im energized by the pace of innovation and the momentum across the company with 15 products that each serve half a billion people and six that serve over 2 billion each we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission thank you to our
 employees around the world for the great work this quarter over to you philip thankssar and hello everyone happy to be here with you all today lets jump right into our performance for the quarter google services revenues of 66 billion were up 5 year on year in google advertising search and other revenues grew 5 year on year led by solid growth in the retail vertical in youtube ads revenues were up 4 year on year driven by growth and brand followed
 by direct response reflecting further stabilization and advertiser spent in network revenues declined 5 year on year google other revenues were up 24 year on year led by strong growth and youtube subscriptions revenues lets out take a few minutes to cover our three key priority areas google ai retail and youtube which ive laid out in prior quarters as clear opportunities for longterm advertising growth ill then turn it over to ruth for more details on our financial performance
 q2 was a big quarter for google ai and our ads products io gml and brandcast were testament to our deep commitment to building cuttingedge tools and solutions that help businesses navigate complexity in real time and deliver the results they need all while improving the experience for users sunder covered some of these innovations ill share more its worth reiterating that while generative ai is no supercharging new and existing ads products with tons of potential ahead ai has been a
 the core of our ads business for years in fact today nearly 80 of advertisers already use at least one ai powered search ads product our approach to ai and ads remains grounded
 in understanding what drives real value for businesses right now and whats most helpful for users advertisers tell us theyre looking for more assistive experience to get set up with us faster so at gml we launched a new conversational experience in google ads powered by a llm tune specifically from ads data to make campaign construction easier than ever advertisers also tell us they want help creating high quality ads that work in an instant so were rolling out a revamped asset creation flow in perform
 max that helps customers adapt and scale their most successful creative concepts in a few clicks and theres even more with pmax we launched a new asset insights and new search term insights that improve campaign performance understanding and new customer life cycle goals that let advertisers optimize for new and existing customers while maximizing sales weve long said its all about reaching the right customer with the right creative at the right time so later this year
 automatically created assets which are already generating headlines and descriptions for search ads will start using generative ai to create assets that are even more relevant to customer queries broadmetch also got updates aibased keyword prioritization ensures the right keyword bid budget creative and lending page is chosen when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible and then to make it easier for advertisers to optimize visual storytelling and drive consideration in the midfunnel were launching
 two new ai part ad solutions demand jan and video view campaigns and both will include shorts inventory sunda talked earlier about sge and our early experiments with new ad formats when active conversations with advertisers publishers and partners to get their input on how to make these solutions work best for them and are excited to test and evolve this experience as we learn more lets pivot to retail where we had a good quarter profitability remains a top theme for retailers
 so solutions like pmax that drive bottom line value continue to do well we also continue to see success in helping businesses unlock efficient growth and deliver on their omni channel goals take a hardware who tapped into aip search and omnibidding to capture increase seasonal demand leading up to memorial day this drove increases across online sales store visits and in store sales resulting in 87 yearyear growth in omnirevenue from google ads
 and led to one of the largest revenue vs ever for a store owners q2 also brought innovation on the consumer and merchant front we rolled out a new gial tryon tool that brings the fitting room experience online shoppers can try on womens tops across a wide array of models from brands like anthropology everlane hm and loft rich visual engaging content is a winwin for both consumers and merchants in fact produc
 with more than one image see a 76 average increase in impressions and a 32 increase in clicks our new product studio uses gni to help retailers create tailored eye catching imagery for free and were working towards optimizing for performance we think this will be a game changer especially for snbs who can now create high quality images to use both across google and their own sites without spending a lot of time or money
 as we continue to make google a valuable place for merchants to grow their businesses and connect with users merchant center next is another win weve seen twox growth in the number of businesses using merchant center in the past two years and were now simplifying it by automating inventory management and giving a consolidated view of performance insights better tools means better growth for merchants and better experiences for users moving to youtube ive said it before ill say it again youtube starts with our cre
 and its their success and our multiformat strategy that will drive youtubes longter growth in prior quarters ive laid out how we think about this enabling our creators to make a living on our platform with more formats and awesome tools leads to more content which leads to quality consumption of video content another big focus of the team and this leads to better opportunities for monetization and for advertisers to support this incredible ecosystem as we think about growth were focused on shorts
 connected tv and our subscription offerings all of which grew nicely this quarter let me double click into shorts and ctv first shorts momentum remains strong watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction last year we introduced ads on shorts to help drive performance and direct response campaigns via video action performance maxs and app campaigns as of q2 brand advertisers can start testing shorts ads and awareness campaigns its still early
 days but were excited by the results la neige a more pacifics number one premium skincare brand was an early adopter it leaned into video reach campaigns and new creative over 10day test to drive a
 21 increase in unique users reach from shorts and infeed all the more efficient cpm second connected tv substantial engagement by viewers and i for advertisers is driving monetization of the living room we are very pleased with the growth weve seen and how were delivering the reach results and relevance that businesses are looking for at scale at brandcast we announce two new ad offerings for streaming first 30 second un
 ads are coming to youtube select which is lending 70 plus of impressions on the tv screen 30 second ads are staple and now youtube is bringing audience capabilities and unparalleled reach to the format were also exploring you pause experiences so brands can drive awareness or action when you hit pause looking at youtube holistically according to our measurement partners transunion and
 and other online video on average take the hershey company as part of a multiyear partnership to optimize its youtube strategy hersheys brands have been tapping into ctv efficient ai pow formats and made for platform creative leading to youtube becoming its number one i driving media partner producing a 65 plus increase in rri from 2018 to 2023 one last highlight that bridges the power of youtube with our continued efforts to bring the best
 across google to our partners with warner brothers discovery we expanded our multiyear relationship across our entire android ecosystem including partnering on the launch of max a deepened mutually beneficial relationship on google tv and plans to work together on new surfaces youtubes expanded deal for max inclusive of a max nfl sunday ticket bundle on youtube tv also underscores our joint commitment to bring the highest quality content and experiences to our customers ill close by 
 sundar with a huge thank you to googlers everywhere for their incredible passion and hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust ruth over to you thank you philip before i go into the results first sundar thank you very much for the opportunity im very excited about the new role and i look forward to it so turning to the results were very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter which reflect an acceleration of growth in search and momentum
 cloud my comments will be on yearoveryear comparisons for the second quarter unless i state otherwise i will start with results at the alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook for the second quarter our consolidated revenues were 74.6 billion up 7 or up 9 in constant currency search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth total cost of revenues was $31.9 billion
 up 6 driven by other cost of revenues of $19.4 billion which was up 8 growth here was driven by content acquisition costs primarily for youtube subscription offerings followed by hardware costs associated with pixel family launches in the second quarter as noted in our earnings release the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense
 due to the change in estimated useful lives we discussed last quarter operating expenses were $20.9 billion up 4 operating income was $21.8 billion up 12 and our operating margin was 29 i will cover our expense and margin performance in our outlook other income and expense was 65 million net income was $18.4 billion
 we delivered free cash flow of $21.8 billion in the second quarter and 71 billion for the trailing 12 months reflecting improved operating performance as well as the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023 as noted in our earnings release we ended the quarter with $118 billion in cash and marketable securities turning to our segment results prior period results have been recast for two changes that we made as of the
 quarter first deepmind is now reported as part of alphabets unallocated corporate costs second we updated our cost allocation methodologies in the second quarter we then combined the brain team from google research with deep mind to form google deepmind costs associated with the brain team which were previously included in google services are now reported as part of alphabets we have not
 recast prior period results to reflect this additional change within google services revenues were 66.3 billion up 5 google search and other advertising re
 of 42.6 billion in the quarter were up 5 led by growth in retail youtube advertising revenues of 7.7 billion were up 4 driven by brand advertising followed by direct response reflecting further stabilization in spending by advertisers network advertising revenues of 7.9 billion were down 5 other revenues were 8.1 billion up 24
 reflecting growth in youtube nonadvertising revenues primarily from subscription growth in youtube music premium and youtube tv followed by growth in hardware revenues primarily driven by the launch of the pixel 7a in the second quarter finally play return to positive growth in the second quarter tech was 12.5 billion up 3 google services operating income was 23.5 billion
 8 and the operating margin was 35 turning to the google cloud segment revenues were 8 billion for the quarter up 28 gcp revenue growth remains strong across geographies industries and products that being said we saw continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimized their spend google workspace strong revenue growth was driven by increases in both seats and average re
 revenue per seat google cloud had operating income of 395 million and the operating margin was 5 as to our other bets for the second quarter revenues were 285 million and the operating loss was 813 million the decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by a reduction in valuation based compensation liabilities related to certain other bets turning to our out
 for the business with respect to google services first within advertising we were pleased with the acceleration of search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter our continued ability to generate sustained growth reflects our unparalleled engineering innovation that creates extraordinary experiences for users and capabilities for advertisers and delivered with the deep expertise of our go to market team and in youtube we saw ongoing signs of stabilization
 in advertiser spending we are prioritizing product focus on increasing quality consumption of video content with both shorts and in the living room which is translating into improved monetization second within other revenues in our youtube subscription products the sustained strong growth in revenues reflects significant subscriber growth you may have seen that last week we increased subscription prices for youtube music and premium with
 underscores the value of the products strong yearonyear growth in hardware revenues was due in large part to a timing change given the pixel 7a was launched in the second quarter whereas the pixel 6a launch occurred in the third quarter last year looking ahead the launch timing change will be a headwind to hardware revenue growth in the third quarter play return to positive growth in the second quarter driven primarily by a solid increase
 the number of buyers turning to google cloud we are particularly excited about the customer interest in our ai optimized infrastructure our large language models our ai platform services and our new generative ai offerings such as duet ai for google workspace although we are still clearly in the early days at the same time we continue to experience headwins in the second quarter for moderation in consumption growth as customers optimize their
 spend we continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth in terms of expenses and profitability we remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base most evident to date are the actions we have taken to reduce the pace of headcount growth including the workforce reductions we announced in the first quarter and a slower pace of organic hiring and part given our focus on reallocating talent from within to
 a quick on the sequential improvement in operating margins in the second quarter there first the benefit in search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter the vast majority of the charges related to our workforce reduction and optimization of our global office space were taken in q1 finally as it relates to
 in q2 the largest component was for servers which included a meaningful increase in our investments in ai compute the sequential step in the second quarter
 was lower than anticipated for two reasons first with respect to office facilities we continue to moderate the pace of fitouts and groundup construction to reflect the slower expected pace of headcount growth second there were delays and certain data center construction projects we expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure increasing through the back half of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024
 the primary driver is to support the opportunities we see in ai across alphabet including investments in gpus and proprietary tpus as well as data center capacity with all that said we remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of longterm sustainable financial value thank you sundar philip and i will now take your questions 
 thank you as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone to prevent any background noise we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated our first question comes from brian nowak of morgan stanley please go ahead taking my questions i i have to
 first one uh for sundar sundar be curious to learn about some of your early learnings and surprises around consumer behavior and how people are using bard versus search and what new behaviors or consumer utility are you most excited about as you think about what gemini could provide for people over the course of the next year or so and then the second one for ruth um ruth congrats on the new uh grats on the new position um one question is about the uh the the durable expense
 i think last quarter you talked about the idea that expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024 is that still the right way to think about it and just to confirm does that include the impact of depreciation in those comments thanks thanks brian ill take the first part um its definitely early days uh but both are crossbard and search generative experience uh you feedback has been uh very positive from our users
 i think you know we are definitely now uh you know able to serve uh you know i would say deeper and broader uh information use cases uh which is very exciting now i wouldnt say surprise so for example people really using it to to for coding uh something we understood but its definitely on the new side theres a lot of excitement around
 we integrated google lens into board we have known how how big google lens can be we see that in the visual searches we get and how much it has grown over the last uh two years and so weve been doing this for a while but definitely uh that inb has been uh super well received so which gives me a sense that as given gemini is being built from the ground up to be multiodal i think thats an area thats going to excite users and i go back many years ago when we did universal search
 whenever for users we can abstract different content types and put them in a seamless way uh they tend to receive it well and so im definitely excited about whats ahead and on your second question uh brian um we are really pleased with the operating performance in the second quarter weve been saying for some time that we are focused on revenue growth um ahead of expense growth and achieved that for the first time in some time and that is um cost of sales plus operating expense
 um overall and we do remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost space there are a lot of stream work streams that are in flight and i mentioned a couple of them in opening comments this remains a uh major priority as sunder and i both commented on great thank you b thank you the next question comes from eric sheridon of goldman sax please go ahead thank you
 so much for taking the questions uh maybe one for sundar and one also for ruth uh sundar you can can you talk a little bit about elements of open source versus closed and and things of like custom silicon and how youre thinking about ai offerings broadly developing over the next couple years and what you see is some of the key differentiation points that google either through the cloud business or the consumer offerings are going to bring to market and how we should think about differentiation playing out to a greater degree in ai
 in the years ahead that would be number one and then ruth alecko brians congrats as well on the new role you maybe both of you could talk to why this type of role might be important at this point in time for alpha
 that and and ruth what youre looking to sort of drive into the organization from this new role as you move into it in the fall thanks uh thanks eric on the first part you obviously a big topic uh you would broadly say the the investments for ai you when you look at the uh type of deep computer science work the talent we worked hard to bring to the company and from the ground up the in
 structure we have built from the earliest days uh google has been a company we weve thought about the switches in our data centers wherever we think we can do the best and get a get an advantage uh by uh by innovating uh weve chosen to do so we have done that on ai on the on the silicon side uh but whats important to us is uh really you know stay focused on our users and customers and you know support all all the innovations thats needed
 so for example with cloud weve been weve really embraced a open architecture uh weve uh you know we have embraced customers wanting to be multioud when it makes sense for them so similarly you would see with ai we will embrace uh we will offer not just our first party models well offer third party models including open source models i think open sources are critical role to play in this uh ecosystem uh google contributes we want
 the largest contributors to if you if you look at hugging phase and in terms of the contribution there when you look at projects like android chromium and so on kubernities and so on so well embrace that and well stay at the cutting edge of technology and i think i think that will serves well uh for the long term on the second part of your uh question uh first of all uh im uh very grateful and thankful to all the work that root has done for the company its too invaluable
 to capture in uh in words i am super thrill that shes going to continue uh on an impactful new role uh and at the scale of our company uh with the broad changes in technology i think its more important than ever before to engage on these issues globally at scale uh you know and and advocate on the economic opportunity of the investments we make across alphabet and google and im im glad that shes going to continue a cfo and so no changes
 there and well take the time to find a successor and ruth will be closely involved uh not just on that but also our uh long range planning including uh 2024 anything that just to underscore when you ask the point about impact one of the places uh sunder and i have discussed quite a bit is landing well the 2024 capital plan and the multiyear plan and completing all of the uh very important efforts we have underway were excited about what they mean setting the company up well to be able to invest for longterm growth and
 so were continuing to execute against those and then i think sunder uh summarized it well we see technology can make such a difference in the lives of so many and the lives of economies and to be able to focus on the impact on economic growth and the opportunity for people for organizations for countries i think is a privilege im really excited about it in particular with this amazing company and so focusing there as well as the investments that we make across alphabet to drive economic growth globally across
 uh numerous sectors great thank you thank you the next question comes from doug anmuth of jp morgan please go ahead thanks for taking the questions um one for sundar one for ruth uh first sundar curious how do you think about timing for more broadly integrating generative ai into search and more specifically what are some of the things youll need to see to do that and then
 ruth just on capex the 2q capex lower than expected as you explain do you still expect modestly higher capex in 23 versus 22 and then i know its getting a little bit ahead but how should we think about kind of timing of that real estate and office optimization efforts you now through 23 and then also into 24 thanks look uh on on the third generative experience uh you know we we we definitely uh
 you know wanted to make sure were thinking deeply from first principles uh while its exciting new technology weve constantly been bringing in uh you know ai innovations into search for the past few years and this is the next step in the journey uh but you know it it is a big change so we thought about from first principles it really gives us a chance to now uh not always be constrained in the way
 search was working before allowed us to think outside the box and you know i see that play out in the experience so i would say you know we are ahead of where i thought we wed be at this point in time  the
 feedback has been very positive uh youve just improved our efficiency uh pretty dramatically since the product launched the latency has improved significantly uh we are keeping a very high bar and but i i would say we are ahead on all the metrics uh in terms of how we look at it internally and so could be more pleased with it and so you will you will see us continue to uh bring it to more and more users and over time this will just be how search works and so while its uh you know we are taking
 great steps you know we are building the next major evolution in search and im pleased with how its going so far in terms of um capex i tried to lay out sort of the cadence of capex and the point was an important one that the sequential step up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for the two reasons i noted one um the work that were doing around office facilities and then the delays in certain data center construction projects but thats why we wanted to be really clear that we do expect l
 related levels of investment in our technical infrastructure and that would be increasing through the back half of 2023 consistent with the comments weve made previously that we had expected 2023 to be higher and given the slower start at the front half of the year and then continuing to grow into 2020 uh for and the primary driver of this as you know well is to support the opportunities we see in ai across the company um including the investments that weve already talked about proprietary tpus all that were doing
 um with gpus as well as data center capacity and as we continue to see the pace of innovation um excelerate we just want to make sure were positioned to address the opportunity um across alphabet and to your the other part of your question when we look at real estate optimization thats one of many workstreams um that are important when we talk about durably reengineering our cost base to create capacity for investments and support longterm um sustainable financial value and were continuing to work against that
 thank you both thank you the next question comes from lloyd walmsley of ubs please go ahead uh thanks for lot for taking the question i wanted to just follow up on the uh some of the sge questions and just get a sense i know its its early but what are you seeing in terms of of monetization um and and how do you guys think about that as you scale
 up the deployment of sge is that i think theres a lot of concern out there that that maybe in the short term its a bit of a head win but over the longer term maybe maybe query growth from a more useful product can kind of kind of make up for that but how do you guys uh see that playing out and and and what can you share there uh maybe i can give some color here uh you know weve obviously been focused on
 bringing this experience and making sure it works well uh for users and its very clear to me first of all as a user myself there are certain queries for which the answers are so so significantly better uh its a clear quality win and and so i think we we are uh definitely headed in the right direction and we can see it in our metrics and the feedback were getting from our uses as well and the thing that doesnt change uh with these experiences is is that many
 you a lot of user journeys are commercial in nature you know the there are inherent commercial user needs and whats exciting to me is that uh sge gives us an opportunity to serve those needs again better right and uh better so its clearly an exciting area and its part of that uh the fundamentals dont change users have commercial needs and they are looking for choices and there are merchants and advertisers looking to provide those choices so those
 fundamentals are true in uh sg as well and you know we have a number of experiments in flight including ads and we are pleased with the early results we are uh seeing and so uh you know we will continue to have all the experience but im comfortable at what we are seeing and we have we have a lot of experience working through these transitions and well bring all those learnings here as well all right thank you thank you
 the next question comes from justin post of bank of america please go ahead great thank you uh just asked about the cloud it really looks like revenue growth stabilized despite optimization so could you talk about um the pipeline and and the client wins in the quarter uh how you fell about those and then any up tick are you seeing related to ai spending uh in in the total revenues this quarter or in the second half thank you
 thanks justin uh okay it is an exciting moment uh overall uh in cloud because there is definitely a lot of interest from customers on on ai
 and they definitely are engaging uh in many more conversations uh with us so you would say without commenting on the short term but when i think about it long term i view the ai opportunity as expanding our total addressable market and allows us to win uh new customers uh you scale of uh scale of uh investments that we can directly bring to cloud now you know as i said earlier we have over 80 model
 across vertex enterprise search and conversational ai and we are taking all of them translating it into deep industry solution so you no excited about it second it gives us an opportunity to upsell and crosssell into our install base so for example if you think about ai in google workspace now its a collection of all our generative ai pad collaboration uh features uh we can bring it and make it available to more than 9 million paying google work
 workspace customers similarly do at ai in google cloud uh you again allows us to uh go back to our install base and engage in deeper conversations and finally i think ai helps us differentiate our core products uh for example if you take a look at cyber security uh we are deeply incorporating ai to to uh you drive profound uh changes there so overall im excited uh excited and i view this is a long term
 opportunity and all the investments we are doing in ai across alphabet including uh you the work we are doing in google deep mind and google research on gemini and so on are directly applicable to cloud as well so uh excited about it great thank you may maybe one follow for ruth um did did the infrastructure cloud growth faster than workspaces again this quarter um so we um
 we did i dont think we we commented on that yes in the second quarter gcp growth was above uh the growth rate for cloud overall great thank you thank you the next question comes from michael nathanson of moffet nathanson please go ahead thanks one for philip one for uh sundar so we talk about the the ad market if you step back youre seeing real
 signs now weakness in in linear tv add agencies smaller digital companies were all slowing and the macro backdops definitely cloudy uh yet you guys have accelerated your growth this quarter what factors are you looking at do you see that would you identify why are you growing while others are are really struggling and slowing now and then sendar i think you spent over a hund billion dollars on rd over the past five years um and yet theres a narrative that its so competitive and
 expensive to to compete going forward you talk talk a bit about how youre revisiting that rd spend any near term cadence updates can give us for growth and any factors that could change the growth going forward for research and spending for you guys thanks maybe i can comment on the how you think about rd and look if anything i think two things we are always
 committed to driving uh deep computer science research and innovation thats the foundation on which the company is built and uh taking that and applying it and building new products and services and generating value uh is the virtuous cycle and you so nothing changes in that fundamental thesis uh we are definitely you know both you know as mentioned on ai investments we are going to be uh committed to making sure we invest realize the opportunity but all the work we had
 doing on efficiency and optimization applies to on the ai side as well and so were bringing all that lens there so that we do this uh responsibly but no overall changes in our philosophy or approach there and and maybe ill let philip comment on the overall market dynamics yes look i cant comment on others but our focus continues obviously to be helping customers through whatever uncertainty or complexity theyre facing and a lot of companies are focused on profitability
 driving efficiencies and and theyre carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets and our goal is really to help them maximize efficiency and drive star ri and i think uh we have the proven ai power tools and solutions uh to actually do it i called out search and other revenues being led by solid growth retail vertical um we uh talked about uh the dr and brand side on the youtube side um i think those are the key uh points i would make
 thank you thank you the next question comes from kenrelsky of wells fargo please go ahead
 yes thank you so much for the the opportunity i appreciate that um uh can i ask on on  performance max youve had great success there could you talk about uh any vertical or or use case expansions and how long until we possibly get uh uh to the point of more automated ai generated creative and production yeah look this is this is a great question uh ai is
 uh foundational component um that really allows us to help users uh advertisers pups partners uh at scale and uh weve been on journey for years right to take the key components of advertising whether its spitning targeting and creatives as well as innovation frankly in the core advertiser and publisher experiences and improve them dramatically through uh ai and performance max is an example of how all this comes together at scale uh for advertisers they provide us
 with a business goal a set of assets and we can then take care of the rest to meet consumer demand and and really deliver on advertiser ri and as you heard at gml uh weve seen over many quarters we continue to build new ai features really uh on top of this um i think i talked a bit um in my prepared remarks about where were taking some of our products from a gen ai perspective and if you take a look at some of the things um we announced there um its fair to say uh with
 that you look at uh or revampt asset creation flow and performance max whether you look at automatically created assets whether you look at product studio and so on um then were on a right path to deliver some really exciting new innovation in automated let me call it asset creation in the broader sense thank you thank you our last question comes from mark mahany
 of evercore please go ahead okay um actually ill ill follow up on that last question philip um you you pointed out ais been used to improve the advertising mouse trap at google for you many years do you view generative ai as just an uh material accelerant of your ability to retur to improve return on ad spend for the millions of marketers who use google and if you think about where generative ai would have the most impact could you
 you could you peel it apart whats your guess now over the next couple years where its going to have the most impact on the creative on the audience creation on the the campaign optimization where do you think the most impact will come from generative ai just for all the the that your your advertising customers thanks well look as i said earlier generative ai is supercharging new and existing ads products with really tons of potential ahead and th were really helping advertisers here make better decisions solve problems uh enhance creativity and i cover
 this earlier um for example we launched a new conversational experience in google ads um the as creation flow and pmax i mentioned the automatically created assets the product studio uh and so on um when i talk to customers theyre very excited about ai and understandably have some questions uh one of the top questions is for example whats the next best step i should take uh and this is a key reason why we launched our google ads ai essentials which was a big announcement at gml uh its a checklift of simple steps
 customers can take right now to unlock the power of ai and it has to do with the foundation of data and measurement it has to do with taking action with our ai proud products and it really um is a mindset shift to set up organizations for ai success so those are just some of the examples um if you extrapolate this uh going forward those are some of the examples where i see a lot of upside apart from the points thats on already mentioned and i think all of this is before we have a multiodal capabilities really in the mix and and so
 uh looking at the early innovations there i think its going to be an exciting uh couple years ahead thanks mark thank you sindar thank you philip congratulations ruth thank you and that concludes our question and answer session for today id like to turn the conference back over to jim friedland for any further remarks thanks everyone for joining us today we
