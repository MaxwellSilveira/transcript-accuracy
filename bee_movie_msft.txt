Hey. Ohh. According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care What humans think is impossible. Yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, Ohh, black and yellow. Yeah, let's shake it up a little. Webcast is ready coming. Now hang on a second.

Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. It's a special day. Finally graduating. Never thought I'd make it. Yeah. Three days of grade school, 3 days of high school. This was so awkward. 3 days of college. I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. Growing a mustache looks good. Hey, did you hear about Frankie? Yeah. You're going to his funeral. No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows. Just think, someone you die, you don't waste it on a squirrel. It was such a hot head. Yeah, I guess it could have just gotten out of the way. Whoa, whoa. I love this, incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations. Why? Quite a bit of pump under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men. We are be men. Amen. Hallelujah. Please welcome Dean Boswell. Welcome new high of city graduating class of. 9/15. Yeah, and that concludes our graduation ceremonies. Hey, and begins your career at Honex Industries. Are we gonna pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation, Huh. Whoa, heads up. Here we go. Keep your hands in antennas inside the tram at all times. Mantenga Susmann OSI antennas Adentro del carril momento. I wonder what it's gonna be like a little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it. Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Valiant pollen jocks bring the Nectar to the hive. Our top secret formula is automatically color corrected, Santa adjusted, and bubble contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow. You all know us, hey? That girl was hot. She's my cousin. She is? Yes. We're all cousins, right? You're right. He also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. Hey. What do you think? He makes enough? And here we have our latest advancement. Wow, what does that? That hangs after you pour. It saves us millions. Can anyone work on the crewman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones, but bees know that every small job it's done well means a lot. But choose carefully, because you'll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. Same job for the rest of your life. I didn't know that. What's the difference? Haven't had one day off in 27,000,000 years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow. That blew my mind. What's the difference, Adam? How could you say that? One job forever. That's an insane choice to have to make. Well, I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Barry, why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on earth. Yeah, but Adam, would you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know, but you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate, Royal Nectar Force. Wait a second. Check it out. Pollen jocks. Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like to go outside the hive, yeah, but some of them don't come back. You guys did great. Your monsters, you Skype freaks. I love it. I love it. I wonder where those guys have just been. I don't know. They're days not planned. Outside of high flying, who knows where doing who knows what. You can't just decide one day to be a pollen jock. You have to be bred for that, right? Look at that. That's more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. That's just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it, perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Aren't they our cousins? Too distant? Distant. Look at these two couple of Hive Harrys. Let's have some fun with them. It must be so dangerous being a Paul and Joe. Yeah. One time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one pull on my throat and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. I never thought I'd knock him out. And what were you doing during all of this? Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that if you want. Little Gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah, Gusty. You know we're gonna hit a sunflower patch about 6 miles from here tomorrow. 6 miles, huh? Jump for us. But maybe you're not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not. We're going. Oh. 900 at Jay Gate.

Well, there's a lot of choices, but you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job everyday? Son, Let me tell you something about stirring. You grabbed that stick and you just move it around and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. And you were thinking of what? Making balloon animals. That's a bad job for a guy with a Stinger? Well, no. Your son's not sure he wants to go into honey. Well, funny sometimes. I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny. You're going into honey, Our son. The stirrer. You're gonna be a stirrer.

Oh, oh oh, that was a little weird. I'm talking. Yeah, talking to a pee. Anyway, and the bee is talking to me. I just want you to know that I'm grateful and I'm going to leave now. Ohh wait, wait, wait, wait. How did you do that? What? The talking thing. Ohh. Same way you did, I guess. Honey, you pick it up. Very funny. Yeah, these are funny.

So anyway, what are you going to do Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. You do? Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. Really. My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Oh, oh, anyway, yeah, You see, if you look. See, there's my hive right there. You could see it. You're in Sheep Meadow. Yes. You know the turtle. Ohh. No way I know that area. Do you know who lost the toe ring there? Really. Yes. Why do girls put rings on their toes? I don't know. It's like putting a hat on your knee. Maybe I'll try that. You are right, ma'am. Ohh. Yeah, fine. Just having two cups of coffee. Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee and yeah, so trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. I.

It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans. Humans. I can't believe you were with humans. Giant, scary humans. What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive around real crazy. And do they try and kill you? Like on TV? Some of them. But some of them don't. How'd you get back, Poodle? Look, you did it. And I'm glad you saw whatever you wanted to see out there. You had your experience, and now you're back. You can. Check out your job and everything can be normal. Well, well, well, well. I met someone. You met someone? Will she be Ish? I'm not a wasp. Your parents will kill you. No, no, not a wasp spider. You know I'm not attracted to the spiders. I know what everyone else is like. The hottest thing with the 8 legs and all. I can't get behind that face. So who is she? She's. Human. Ohh. No, no, no, no. That didn't happen. You didn't do that. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. Her name's Vanessa. Ohh boy, she's so nice. And she's a florist. Ohh, no, no, no, no. You're dating a human florist. Well, we're not dating. You're flying outside the hive. You're talking to human beings that attack our homes with power washers and M 80s. That's 1/8 of a stick of dynamite. She saved my life and she understands me. This is over. Eat this. This is not over. What was that? They call it a crumb that was so stinging stripey. And that's not even what they eat. That just falls off what they eat. Do you know what a Cinnabon is? No, It's bread coming. They heat it up. Sit down really hard. Listen to me. We are not them. We're us. There's us and there's them.

Got everything? You go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. I just can't believe. I just can't. What this? We are still here, Barry. I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond when you yell at him. Then why are you yelling at me? Because you don't listen. I'm not listening to this. Sorry, Mom. I've gotta go. Where are you going? Nowhere. I'm meeting a friend. A girl. Is this why you? Can't decide bye. I just hope she's Beish. So they have a huge parade of just flowers every year in Pasadena, Ohh to be in the Tournament of Roses.

Well, you don't have anything like that. We have high value, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. You must just want to sting all those jerks. We really try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you really have to watch your temper. Ohh yeah. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. You work through it like any emotion. Anger, jealousy, lust. Ohh my goodness are you OK? What is wrong with you? It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get outta here. You're creep. What was that?

Why is this here? For people. We eat it. Why? You don't have enough food of your own? Well, yes. How do you even get it? Well, bees make it. I know who makes it, and it's hard to make it. There's heating and cooling and stirring. You need a whole crowning thing. It's organic. It's organic. Honeyberry. Just what Bees don't know about this. This is stealing. A lot of stealing. You've taken our homes, our schools, our hospitals. This is all we have. And it's on sale. I'm going to get to the bottom of this. I'm going to get to the bottom of all of this. Hey, Hector.

Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? A queen was moved here. We had no choice. That's a man and woman's clothes. That's a drag queen. What is this? Ohh no. There's hundreds of them. Be honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale. This is worse than anything the bears have done to us and I intend to do something about it. Ohh, Barry, stop. Who told you that humans are taking our honey? That's just the rumor. Dude. These look like rumors. That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. Barry, how did you get mixed up in all this? Because he's been talking to humans. What? Talking to humans has a human girlfriend? Ohh. Barely. Make out. Make out. Barry. We do not. You wish you could. Whose side are you on? The fees. I dated a cricket. It's in San Antonio. Man. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Had Shiwa Barry. This is what you wanna do with your life. This is what I wanna do for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees. Dad, I remember you coming home some nights so overworked your your hands will still stirring. You couldn't stop them. I remember that. What right do they have to our hard earned honey? We're living on two cups a year. They're putting it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever. Even if it's true, Barry, what could one be do? I'm going to sting them where it really hurts in the face. In the eye, that would really hurt? No. Up the nose, that's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans. One place where it really matters. Live at 55 fully full hour. Action News source. With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk, Weather with Storm Stinger Sports with Buzz Larvae and Jeanette Chung. Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. And I'm Jeanette Chung. Our top story? A tri-county bee, Barry Benson is saying he intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally. Don't forget tomorrow night on TV. Larry King. We're going to have three former Queens all right here in our studio discussing their new book, Classy Ladies out This week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think I'm just a kid from the hive? I can't do this, Larry. Bees have never been afraid to change the world. I mean, what about Bee Columbus? Be Gandhi. But Jesus. Ohh. Where I'm from, you wouldn't think of suing humans. We were thinking more like stickball candy stores. How old are you? Well, I want you to know that the entire Bee community is supporting you in this case, which is certain to be the trial of the B century. Thank you, Larry. You know, I have a Larry King in the human world, too. It's a common name. Next week on B, Larry King. No, I mean, he looks like you. And he has a show with suspenders and different colored dots behind him. Next week on Bee Larry King. Guy glasses. And there's quotes along the bottom from the guest you're watching, even though you just heard him. Bear week, Next week, they're scary. They're hairy and they're here. Live always leans forward, pointy shoulders. Squinty eyes. Very Jewish. Work in In tennis, you attack the point of weakness. But it was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81, honey. Her backhands a joke. I'm not going to take advantage of that. Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. Is that that same baby? Yes, it is. I'm helping him sue the human race. Wow. Hello. Hello. Baby. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland size 10 1/2 Vibram Soul, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go because we're really busy working, but it's our yogurt night. Bye bye. Yogurt night So difficult. Oh, you poor thing. You 2 have been at this for hours. Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me anyway? Bees have good qualities, see Chad. And it feels good to take my mind off the shop. I don't know why, but instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Yeah, those are great if you're 3 and artificial flowers. Yeah, me too. Defense stingers, the pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake plastic things. There's nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Well, maybe this could make up for it a little bit. You know, Barry, this lawsuit is a pretty big deal, I guess. Are you sure that you want to go through with it? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, honey, I'm home without paying a royalty. Sarah It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where all eyes and ears of the world are anxiously waiting. Because for the first time in history, we're going to hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. I don't know, but it's pretty big, isn't it? Can't believe how many humans don't have to be at work during the day. Hey, you think these billion dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay back. Very much. Hmm. What's the matter? I don't know. Just gotta chill. Well, if it isn't the B team. Any of you boys work on this? All right, the honorable Judge bumbled in, presiding. Alright. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York Barry B Benson versus the honey industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five major food companies collectively. A privilege. Mr. Benson. You're representing all bees of the world. Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, We're ready to proceed. And Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, yeah, my grandmother was a simple woman born on a farm. She believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature Gowanda put before us. If we would live in the topsy turvy world. Mr. Benson Mansions just just just think of what it would mean. Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches. Talking bear, How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion picture capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beam robotics, ventriloquism plummeting. For all we know, he could be on steroids. Mr. Vincent. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it, we make it and we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us because we're the little guys. And what I'm hoping is that after this is all over, you'll see how by taking our honey, you're not only taking away everything we have. But everything we are. Oh, I wish you would dress like that all the time. So nice call. Your first witness. So Mr. Klaus van der Hayden of Honey Farms. Pretty big company you have there, I suppose, though. And I see you also own Honey Burton and Home Run. Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I have to say, I don't imagine you employ any bee freers, do you? And no, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. No, no, Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. And not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. Well, they're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear. build-a-bear. Yeah. You mean like this? How's your life? His big hairy head crashes through your living room. Bite into your couch. Spit. Now you throw pillows. Rar, rar. OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. I have to say we haven't heard it before. I was with a band called the Police. But you've never been a police officer of any kind, have you? No, I haven't. No you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture being casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance about stage name. Ohh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say Mr. Gordon? Umm Sumner. Mr. Liotta, first may Ioffer my belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I also see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome, but with a churning inner turmoil that's always ready to blow. I I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you, Mr. Leota? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, Sir. Watch it, Benson. I could blow right now. This isn't a good fella. This is a bad fella. Why doesn't so much just skip on this little creep? We can all go Oh, oh. We're all thinking it. Ohh, what do I say? Well, I just think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I'm telling you, I think the juries on our side. Are we doing everything right? You know, legally, I'm a florist, right? Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team. Well, hello. Ohh Ken. Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call but the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste so I called Barry. Luckily he was free. That was lucky. Well, there's still a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up. Sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. I find the ball a little grabby. That's where I usually sit, right? There, umm Ken. There he was looking at your resume and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. Do we? Well, beast, 100% employment of course, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. I hope that was alright. Ohh. I'm gonna go drain the old Stinger. Yeah, you do that. Oh, oh. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. What's that? Italian? Vogue. Mamma Mia. That's a lot of pages. It's a lot of ads. Remember what Vance said? Why is your life any more valuable than mine? That's funny. I just can't seem to recall that. I think something sticks in here. I love the smell of flowers. Yeah. How do you like the smell of flames? Not as much. Oh, oh, what about not taking sides? Hey, look at me. I'm wearing a chapstick hat. This is pathetic. I've got issue. Well, well, well. Ohh royal flush. You're bluffing. Ohh God. Yeah, there's a pool. Water pool. Whoa. That bowl is nearly except for those dirty yellow rags. What are you doing? You know what I don't even like? Honey, I don't need it. We need to talk. He's just a little B, and he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time. Long time? What are you talking about? Are there other bugs in your life? No. But there are other things bugging me. In life? And you're one of them fine talking bees. No yogurt night. My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster. Goodbye, Ken. Ohh. And for your information, I prefer sugar free artificial sweeteners made by man. All that. I know it's got an after taste. I like it. I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh well, I gotta be OK for the trial tomorrow. Ohh. I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson BB to the stand. Now that's a good idea. You can really see why he's considered one of the very best lawyers. Don't worry, Mr. Gamble. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. You got the tweezers? Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to lose, Mr. Benson, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship? So that woman. We're friends. Good friends. Yes. How good do you live together? Wait a wait a minute. This is all about her little bed bug. Doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children in the hives? Yeah. So those aren't even your real parents. Ohh, Barry. Yes they are. Hold me back. You are an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Vincent? He's denouncing bees. And don't y'all they Chuck cousins. Objection. I'm going to pincushion this guy. And I'm done. That's what he wants. Stop. Ohh Lord. The venom is causing to my main Mr. Muhammad failed by a winged beast of destruction. You see, you can't treat them like Eagles. They're stripping, savages, stinging. The only thing they know, it's their way. Stay with me. Ohh Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison for my healing buttocks. I will have all the him, my court order, order please. The case of the Honey bees? Race to the point to turn against the beach yesterday when one of their. Hey, buddy. Hey. So much pain, yeah. I blew the whole case, didn't I? Ohh. It doesn't matter. The important thing is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria. They got it from downstairs in a tuna sandwich. Look. There's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? Ohh. Adrenaline. And then. And then ecstasy. Alright. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam They check in, but they don't check out. Ohh my. Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? Why the smoke? Bees don't smoke. Please don't smoke. Bees don't smoke. But some bees are smoking. Adam, that's it. That's our case. It is. It's not over. No. Get up. Get dressed. I've got to go somewhere. You get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes, yes, yes, your honor. Where is the rest of your team? Well, well, well, your honor, it's, it's interesting. You know, bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don't make very good time. Actually once heard a pretty funny story about him. Give us bugs taking up enough of this course valuable time. How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for complete dismissal of this entire case. Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't. We have a terrific case. Where's your proof? There's the evidence. Show me the smoking gun. Hold it, Your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker. What? This is harmless little contraption. This couldn't hurt a fly little bee. Ohh members of the jury look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, smoking or non. Is this what nature intended for us to be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines and men made wooden slat work camps living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? What are we going to do? Ladies and gentlemen, please read these bees. Happy, Happy. The court finds in favor of the bees. Vanessa, we won. You can do it. Ohh, sorry. I'm OK. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees now. We won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature. Benson, you'll regret this. How much money do you think it's alright? Alright, one at a time. Gary. Who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren and I have no pants. What if Montgomery's right? What do you mean? Have we been living the way a long time? 27,000,000 years? Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? First? We're going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want to get back all the money that was ours to begin with. Every last drop we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big headed, bad breath stink machine. I believe we're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. We'll have a little nausea for a few hours, then it'll be fine, and we will no longer tolerate derogatory being negative nicknames. But it's just a prance about stage name, unnecessary inclusion of honey and bogus health products, and la Dee da human tea time snack garnishments. You can't breathe. Bring it in, boys. Good. Mr. Push Well, we just passed 3 cups in this gallon. Sports coming. I think we need to shut down. Down. We've never shut down. Shut down honey production. Stop making money. Turn your key, Sir. What are we doing now? Hmm. Cannibal. By shutting down 100 Production aboard Boarding, pollination and nectar detail Returning debate. You wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Ohh yeah. What's going on around here? Where is everybody? Are they out celebrating? No, they're just home. They don't know what to do. They're laying out. They're sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Yeah, but sometimes I think so. What if the humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world. I was excited to be a part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well and now. No, I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. We have so much now. I thought their lives would be better. They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on. Do you want to show me this? Ohh, what happened here? That is not the half of it. Ohh no ohh my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees. Specifically me. I guess they didn't think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. It's not just flowers, fruits, vegetables. They all need bees. Well, that's our whole SAT test right there. So you take away the produce that affects the entire animal Kingdom. And then of course. The human species. So if there's no more pollination. It could all just go South here. Couldn't. And I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? I'll sting you. You step on me. That just kills you twice, right? Listen, Barry. Sorry, but I gotta get going. And open my mouth and talk. Vanessa. Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. They've moved it up to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I I just want to say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses Roses Can't Do Sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses. Roses. Berry roses are flowers. Yes, they are flowers. Bees fallen. I know. That's why this is the last parade. You ask him to slow down. Could you slow down? Oh oh very OK. I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster and it's all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. Ruined the planet and I wanted to help you with your flower shop instead. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. Ohh. I thought maybe you were remodeling. Nonetheless, I have another idea and it's greater than all my previous great ideas come by. I don't want to hear it. Alright, here's what I'm thinking. They have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this part. All we got to do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. These part pollen, flowers, pollination. All right, Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, CA. They got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. Vanessa Bloome, FTD, Official floral business. Oh, it's real. Sorry, ma'am. That's a nice broach, by the way. Thank you. That was a gift. Then once we're inside, we just picked the right flow. How about the Princess and the pea? Yeah, I could be the Princess and you could be. Sorry I'm late. Where should I sit? Wait, you. I believe I'm the P. The P? It's supposed to be under the mattresses, not in this fairy tale. Sweetheart, I'm gonna go talk to the Marshall. You do that. This whole parade is a fiasco. Let's see what this baby will do. What are you doing? Then all we do is blend in with traffic without arousing suspicion. And once we're at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop security. Did you and your insect pack your own float? Yes. Has the float been in your possession the entire time? Yes. Would you remove your shoes and everything in your pockets? Can you remove your Stinger, Sir? That's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. And then, if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the jobs. I think this is gonna work, Vanessa. It's got to work. Attention, passengers. This Captain Scott. I'm afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area, and it looks like we're going to be experiencing a couple of hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I got to get up there and talk to these guys. Be careful. Hey, can I get some help with this Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable ear and Nose hair trimmer. Excuse me, Catherine, I'm in a real situation here. Where'd you say how? I didn't say anything. No, no, don't freak out. There's a chance my entire speech. Doing. Oh, wait a minute. I'm an attorney. Who's an attorney? Don't move. Ohh Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. Your captain speaking would have missed Vanessa Bloom in 24 B. Please report to the cockpit and please. All right. What happened here? I tried to talk to them, but then there was a dust Buster at Topeka. Life raft exploded. Now once bald ones an adult and they're both unconscious. Another B joke. No, no one's flying the plane. Our flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Blue. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Is there anyone on board who has flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. Who's that? Barry Benson from the honey trial. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. Why not? Is it John Travolta pilot? Yes. How hard could it be? Wait a minute, Barry. We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late breaking news from JFK airport where a very suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning legal victory, now attempting to land a plane loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew flowers. We have an electrical storm in the area and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute Mr. Ditchwater. There's a honey bee on that plane. Ohh, I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson's work. And there's no account compadres. Have they done enough damage already? It isn't your only hope right now. Come on, technically a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. The wings are too small. Their bodies are too big. Hold on a second. Haven't we heard this a million times? The surface area of the wings and the body mass doesn't make sense. We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best, working together. That's the be way we're not made of jello. We get behind a fellow black and yellow. Left, right, down, hover, hover, forget hover. You know what? This isn't so hard. Ohh, Mary, what happened? Wait a minute. I think we're on autopilot that whole time that may have been helping me, and now we're not. It turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind us. Pull up over there. Our only chance. If I do what I would do and you copy me with the wings of the plane, you don't have to yell. I'm not yelling. We happen to be in a lot of trouble here. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice. It's not a tone. Bang. I don't think I could do this. Vanessa, pull yourself together. Listen to me. You have got to snap out of it. You snap out of it, You'll snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. Hold it. Why? Come on. It's my turn. How's the plane flying? I don't know. Have you got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? Pollen jocks? They do get behind a fellow black and yellow. Know. What do you say we dropped this 10 can on the black top? Black top Where? I can't see anything. Can you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Come on, you gotta think, Bee Barry. Thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. Thinking. Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. I don't know, but it's strong and it's pulling me like a 27,000,000 year old instinct. Bring the nose of the plane down. What in the world is on the tarmac? Get some lights on that. That's the aim for the flower. OK, cut the engine. The engine. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys. Good, good. Easy now. That's it, man on that flower. Ready, boys. Full reverse bending around. Not that flower. The other flower. Which flower? That flower. I'm having at the flower That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating flower made of millions of bees. Move forward. No sound. Bring your tail up. Rotate around it. No, this is insane Berry. This is the only way I know how to fly. Am I cuckoo could chew or is this plane flying in an insect like pattern? Did you nose in there? Don't be afraid of it smelling fluid versus easy, Just drop it. Be part of it. Now drop it in. Drop it in woman. Yeah. Come on already. Mary, we did it. You taught me how to fly. Yes. No. I5, right, Barry, It worked. Did you see the giant flower? What Giant flower? Where? All the flower. That was Genius, man. Genius. Thank you, but we're not done yet. Listen everyone, this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're going to survive as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say? Are we going to be these? We're just Museum of Natural History key chains. We're Pees keychain. Then follow me except keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah. I'm a pollen jock and it's a perfect fish. Ohh I got to do with the sleeves. Ohh yeah. That's our Barry. Here comes the sun. All right. Little darling, it's been a long, long day. It feels like you since it's been here. Here comes the sun, didn't do it goes the sun and I say. Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces. Little darling, it seems like you since it's been here. Here comes the sun Didn't do Here comes the sun, And I say it's all right. Back. Anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight. Little darling, I feel that ice is solid and have a great afternoon. Can I help? Who's next? Who's next? Like some honey? With that it is be approved. Ohh, don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, It's all me and I don't see a nickel. Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat. I had no idea. Sorry, Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate here will be able to help you. Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too, ma'am. I was already a blood sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon, Barry. I just got this huge Tulip Porter for a wedding and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, Danny. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help? Who's next? Who's next? All right, scramble jocks. It's time to fly. Ohh, that bee is living my life. Let it go Kenny. When will this nightmare end? Here comes the beautiful day to fly. Sure is between you and me. I was dying to get out of that office. It's alright Ohh. To start thinking be my friend thinking B me thinking be thinking. Lying here and buzzing there, I'm loving the views. Listen to me, cousin. Every buzzer must choose to be a bee or not to be thinking. Now you've got no occupation. What do you mean? Like pollination? Now that's thinking. Listen to me, fella, And you've been on that touched. Your strikes are black and yellow. I just wanna be sure you'll be happy. Can I wait and see? Be a busy little peanut butter tizzy little bit. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Everyone, Can we stop here? Ohh, Barry. Look, I'm not making a major life decision in the middle of a huge musical production though, Alright? Alright, take 10 everybody. Wrap it up guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
