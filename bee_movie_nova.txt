The honorable judge Bumbleton presiding. Alright. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York. RAB Benson versus the honey industry is now in session. Mister Montgomery, you're representing the 5 major food companies collectively. A privilege. Mister Benson, you're representing all bees of the world? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Yes, your honor. We're ready to proceed. And mister Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the Jeware. My grandmother was a simple woman born on a farm. She believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature, Gawada, put before us. If we were to live in a topsy-turvy world, Mister Benson Imagine, just just just think of what it would mean. Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my riches. Talking bee. Yeah. How do we know? This isn't some sort of holographic motion picture, capture Hollywood wizardry. They could be using beads. Robotics been triliquids, plumbing for all we know. He could be on their odds. Mister Benson. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. And as a bee hunt is pretty important to me, it's important to all bees. We invented it. We make it, and we protect it with our lives Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us because we're the little guys. And what I'm hoping is that after this is all over, You'll see how by taking our honey, you're not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are. Oh, I wish you would dress like that all the time. So nice. Call your first witness. So mister Klaus Vander Hayden of Honey Farms. Pretty big company you have there. I suppose so. And I see you also own Honeyburton and Unrun. Yes. They provide beekeepers for our farms. bee keeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term, I have to say. I don't imagine you employ any bee freers, do you? No. I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. No. No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. And not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. Well, they're very lovable creature a yoyogi bear, Fazie bear? Build a bear? Yeah. You mean like this? There's kill bees. How's it like his big hairy head crashes through your living room? Fight into your couch. now, you throw pillows. Rgh. Rgh. Okay. That's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me, I have to say. Where have I heard it before? I was with a band called the police. but you've never been a police officer of any kind, have you? No. I haven't. No. You haven't. And so here we have yet another example of b culture being casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prince about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, mister sting, because I'm feeling a little stung sting, or should I say mister Gordon am Sumner. Woah. Not his real name. You can't hear. Woah. Oh. Mister Leota, first may I from my belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I also see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome, but with a churning inner turmoil that's always ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't, but is this what it's come to for you, Mister Leota, exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir. Watch it, Benson. I could blow right now. This isn't a good fella. This is a bad fella. Why doesn't so much just step on this little creek and we can all go home. Or or do I say? Please sit down. Well, I just think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I'm telling you, I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, you know, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team. Well, hello? Oh, Ken. Hello? I didn't think you were coming. No. I was just late. I, tried to call, but the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Berry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. Well, there's still a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah. Heat it sure. Whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. I find the ball a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right. There. Ken? Barry was looking at your resume. Ugh. And he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? Hey. Look. I know how hard it is trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. Do we? Well, peace have 100% employment, of course, but We do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ke? I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was alright. Oh. I'm gonna go drain the old stinger. Yeah. You do Oh. Oh. You know? You know what? just about had it with your little mind games. What's that? Italian vogue. Nam familiar. That's a lot of pages. It's a lot of ads. Remember what Vance said? Why is your life any more valuable than mine? That's funny. I just can't seem recall back. I think something sticks in here. I love the smell of flowers. Yep. How do you like to smell of flames? Not as much. Oh, Oh. Waterbug. Not taking sides. Hey. Look at me. I'm wearing a chopstick at. This is pathetic. I've got a suit. Oh. Well, well, well. A royal flush air bluffing. Am I? Yeah. Woo. Woo. That bow is gnarly, except for those gnarly yellow rings. What are you doing? You know what? I don't even like honey. I don't need it. We need to talk. He's just a little bee, and he the nicest bee I've met in a long time. Long time. What are you talking about? Are there other bugs in your life? No. But there are other things bugging me in life, and you're one of them. Fine. Talking bees, no yogurt night. My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster. Goodbye, Ken. It's for your information. I prefer sugar free, artificial sweeteners, made by man. I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste. I lost it. I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you gonna be okay for the trial tomorrow? Oh, I believe Mister Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mister Barry at Ben send B to the stand. Now, that's a good idea. You can really see why he's considered one of the very best lawyers. Layton, you've gotta wave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Oh, don't worry, Mister Gammell. The only thing I have to do turn this jewelry around as to remind them of what they don't like about bees. You're going to have the tweezers. Are you a large only to losing, son, only to losing. Mr. Benson D. I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exact leads your relationship to that woman. We're friends. Good friends. Yes. How good. Do you? We have together. Wait a minute. This isn't about her little bed bug. Hey, that's the cat. I've seen a bee document around too. Now from what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children in the high Yeah. But So those aren't even your real parents. Oh, Barry? Yes. They are. Hold me back. You're an illegitimate bee. you, Benson? He's denouncing bees. And don't y'all nature cousins. Objection. I'm gonna pin cushion this guy. Hey. I'm done. The 20 wants. Oh, I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. Oh, lordy. I'm here. I'm here. I'm Mister Watay. I have been failed by wing at least the destruction. You see? You can't treat a black equals. There's stripe at Salitors. Giggings, the only thing they know. It's their way. Adam, stay with me. I I can't feel my legs. Oh, the angel of mercy will come forward to set the poison for my healing buckets. We do. we'll have ordered life. Oh, order, please. The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a point to in against the beach yesterday for one of your legal team's done latent team on govery. Now here's Don with a 5 day. Hey, buddy. Hey. It's a much pain. Yeah. I I blew the whole case, didn't I? Oh, it doesn't matter. The important thing is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off, dude. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria. They got it from downstairs in a tuna sandwich. Look, There's a little salary still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all all adrenaline, and then and then ecstasy. Alright. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check-in, but they don't check out. Oh my. Say, could you Get a nurse to close that window. Why? The smoke. bees don't smoke. Ryan, bees don't smoke. bees don't smoke, but some bees are smoking. Adam, that's it. That's our case. It is? It's not over. No. Get up. Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. You get back to the court and stall. Stahl any way you can. And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mister Flame, Yes. Yes. Yes. Your honor. Where is the rest of your team? well, well, your honor, it's it's interesting. You know, bees are trained to kind of haphazardly. And as a result, quite often, we don't make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about it. You ought to have at these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time. How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have no more compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. Mister Flamein, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mister Montgomery's motion But you can't. We have a terrific case. Where's your proof? Where's the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker. What? This is harmless little contraption. It couldn't hurt a fly out of the Ruby. members of the jury look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, smoking, or none. Is this what nature intended for us? to be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines and man made wooden slat work camps, living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man. What are we gonna do? Just play the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Read these The court finds in favor of the beast. Vanessa, we won. Yay. I knew you could do it. Bye bye. I'm sorry. I'm okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? Oh, the honey is finally gonna belong to the bees. we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is a unaholdy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry? How much honey do you think is out there? Alright. one at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? my sweater's Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. What if Montgomery's right? What do you mean? We've been living the Beaway a long time. 27000000 years. Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? 1st, we're gonna demand a shutdown of all b work cams. Then we wanna get back all the money that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy smelly, big headed, bad breath stank machine. I believe we're all aware of what they do woods. Wait for my signal. Take them out. We'll have a little nausea for a few hours, then it'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate derogatory bee negative nicknames. but it's just a prance about stage name. Unnecessary inclusion of honey and Pogo's health products, and Lundidah human tea time snack garnishments. You can't breathe. Bring it in. right there. Good. I'm good. This plus well. He's just past three cups and his gallons more is coming. I think we need to shut down. Shut down. We've never shut down. production. Stop making money. Turn your key, sir. What do we do now? Cannonball. We're shutting down honey production. validation and nectar details, returning to Maine. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah. What's going on around here? Where is everybody? Are they out celebrating? No. They're just home. They don't know what to do. They're laying out. They're sleeping in. I heard your uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio for the cricket. At least we got our honey back. Yeah. But sometimes I think so. What humans liked our honey. Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world. I was excited to be a part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. We have so much now. I thought their lives would be better. They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? What did you wanna show me? This. Oh, what happened here? That is an to half of it. Oh, no. Oh my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, doesn't? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess b's. b's? Specifically me. I guess I didn't think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. It's not just flowers, fruits, vegetables. They all need bees. Oh, that's a whole SAT test right there. So you take away the produce that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course, the human species. Oh, so if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here. Couldn't it? And I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? I'll sting you. You step on me. That just kills you twice. Right. Listen Barry. Sorry. But I gotta get going. had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa, why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final tournament of Rosa's in Pasadena. They've moved it up to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa just wanna say I'm sorry. I I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. ornament of roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses. Vanessa. Roses? Roaches are flower. Yes. They are. Flowers, please. Bollin. I know. That's why this is the last play. Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down? Could you slow down? Barry. Okay. I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, and it's all my fault. Yes. It kind of is. I ruined the on it, and I wanted to help you with your flower shop. Instead, I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling. Nonetheless, I have another idea, and it's greater than all my previous great ideas combined. I don't want to hear it. Oh. Alright. Here's what I'm thinking. They have the roses. The sizes have the pollen. I know every bee plant and flower bud in this part. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. bees. Park. Poland. Flowers. Repalination. Rustination. Alright. tournament of roses. Pasadena Cal on you. They got nothing but flowers floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloom, FTD, official floral business. Oh, it's real. Sorry, ma'am. That's a nice approach, by the way. Thank you. There was a gift. Then once inside, we just pick the right float. How about the princess and the pea? Yeah. I could be the princess and you. Yes. I think. added. Sorry, I'm late. Where should I sit? Where are you? I believe I'm the p? The p. It's supposed to be under the mattresses. Not in this fairy tale. sweetheart. I'm gonna go talk to the marshal. You'll do that. This whole parade is a fiasco. Let's see what this baby dough. Hey. What are you doing? Then all we do is blend in with traffic without arousing suspicion. And once we're at the airport, There's no stopping us. Stop security. Did you and your insect pack your own float? Yes. Has the flopping in your possession the entire time? Yes. Would you remove your shoes and everything in your pockets? Can you remove your stinger, sir? that's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. And then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job. I think this is gonna work, Vanessa. It's got to work. Attention passengers. This captain Scott. I'm afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area, and it looks like we're gonna be experiencing a couple of hours delay. Barry? These are cut flowers with no water. Don't let bake it. I gotta get up there and talk to these guys. Be careful. Hey, I get some help with this Sky Mall magazine. I'd like to order the talking inflatable ear and nose hair trimmer. Excuse me, captain. I'm in a real situation here. What'd you say, Hal? I didn't say anything. Me. Oh, no. No. Don't freak out. There's a chance. My entire space. Wait a minute. I'm an attorney. Who's an attorney? don't move. Oh, Barry. Afternoon passengers. you captain speaking. Would it miss Vanessa Bloom in 24 B? Please report to the cockpit, and please, alright. What happened here? I tried to talk to them, but then there was a dust buster at toupee, a life raft exploding. Now one's ball, one's in a boat in both unconscious. That's not a bee joke. No. No one's flying the plane. This is JFK control tower flight 3 56. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloom. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious and so is the co pilot? Not good. Is there anyone on board who has flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. Who's that? Barry Benson. From the Honey trial Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal b. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. Why not? Is it John Choolta pilot? Yes. How hard could it be? Wait a minute, Barry. We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late breaking news from JFK Airport where a very suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh off his legal victory. That's very is now attempting to land a plane loaded with people, flowers, and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers? Oh, we have an electrical storm in the area and 2 individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute, Mister Ditchwater. There's honeybee on that plane. Oh, I'm quite familiar with Mister Benson's work and there's no account capadres. Haven't they done enough damage already? It isn't a only hope right now? Come on. Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. The wings are too small. The bodies are too big. Hold on a second. Haven't we heard this a million times? the surface area, the wings, and the body mass doesn't make sense. Get this on the air. You got it. Standby. We're going live. We're gonna be out of the water. The way we work may be a mystery to you because making honey takes a lot of bees, doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. more than we realized, to us, to everyone. That's why I wanna get bees back to doing what we do best. Working together. That's the b way. We're not made a jello. We get behind a fellow. Black and yellow. Left, write down, hover. Hover. Forget hover. You know what? isn't so hard. Be beep. Beep. Sorry. What happened? Wait a minute. And I think we were on autopilot that whole time. That may have been helping me. And now we're not. It turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of Let's get behind us. Our only chance if I do what I would do and you copy me with the wing to the You don't have to yell. I'm not yelling. We happen to be in a lot of trouble here. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice. It's not tone, I'm panicking. I don't think I could do this. Vanessa, pull yourself together. Listen to me. You have got to snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. No. Stop out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. Oh, hold it. Hi. Come on. It's my turn. How's the plane flying. I don't know. Hello? Hey, Benson. Have you got any flowers for happy occasion in there. Apologics. They do get behind a fellow. Wack in yellow. Hello. Alrighty, you too. What are you saying about this ten on the blacktop. What blacktop where? I can't see anything. Can you? No. Nothing. It's all cloudy. Come on. You gotta think bee, Barry. Thank you b. Taking me. Making me. Taking me. Thinking me. Thinking me. Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. What? don't know, but it's strong, and it's pulling me like a twenty seven million year old instinct. Bring the nose of the plane down. What in the world is on the tarmac? Get some lights on that. And that's the aim for the flower. Okay. Cut the engines. Cut the engines. We're going in on b power. Ready boys. Affirmative. Good. Good. Easy now. That's it. Been on that flower. Ready boys, full reverse. Spin it around. Not that flower and the other flower. Which flower? That flower. I'm aiming at the flower. That's a fat guy in a flower shirt. I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating I made a 1,000,000,000 of bees. Move forward. No sound. Bring your tail up. Don't paint around it. No. This is insane, Barry. This is the only way I know how to fly. Am I cuckoo, or is this plane flying in an insect like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid of it. Smell it. Pull reverse. Easy, just drop it. Be a part of it. Hey for the center. Now drop it in. Covenant Woman. Come on already. Mary, we did it. You taught me how to fly. Yes. No. Highfive. Right. Perry. It worked. Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course, I saw the flower. That was genius man. Genius. Thank but we're not done yet. Listen, everyone. This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only one to make honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say? Are we gonna be bees? or just Museum of Natural History Key Chains. We're peace. Key Chain. Then follow me. accept key chain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. I'm a pollen jock, and it's a perfect 5th. All I gotta do with the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Here comes the sun that say it's alright. it's feels like here since it's been here. goes the sun.

All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon. Barry. I just got this huge Tula Porter for a wedding, and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, for Barry. Can I help who's next? Who's next? Alright. Granville Jocks. It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry. Oh, that bee is living my life. Let it go, Kenny. When will this nightmare end? -- beautiful date of life. Sure is. Between you and me, was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking, be, my friend, thinking be. be. Get far as I think it'd be. Gee. Fine. You're in buzzing there.
