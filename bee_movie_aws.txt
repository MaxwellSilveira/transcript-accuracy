Hey. Oh fuck. Mhm You. Oh According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black. Oh, black and yellow. Yeah, let's shake it up. A little. Breakfast is ready coming. Oh, hang on a second. Hello, Barry Adam. Can you believe this is happening? I can't believe it. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp, Barry. Why don't you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. Sorry, I'm excited. He's the graduate. We're very proud of your son and a perfect report card. All be very proud. I got a thing going here. You got some lids on your fuzz. Oh, that's me. Wave to us. We'll be in row 118,000. Barry. I told you stop flying in the house. Hey Adam. Hey Barry. Is that Fuzz Gel? A little? It's a special day. Finally graduating. I never thought I'd make it. Yeah. Three days of grade school. Three days of high school. This was so awkward. Three days of college. I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. Hi, Barry. Hey, Artie. Growing a mustache. Looks good. Hey, did you hear about Frankie? Yeah. Are you going to his funeral? No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows. You think someone, when you die, you don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead. Yeah, I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. Oh, love this. Incorporating amusement park right into our regular day. I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pump under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men. We are be men. Amen. Hallelujah. Students, faculty, distinguished Bees. Please welcome Dean Boswell. Welcome New hive City. Graduating class of 9 15. Yeah. And that concludes our graduation ceremonies and begins your career at hone industries. Are we gonna pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. It's up here. We go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. I wonder what it's gonna be like. A little scary. Welcome to a division of Haco and a part of the Hexagon group. This is, oh, we know that you as a bee have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the high. Our top secret formula is automatically color corrected, san adjusted and bubble contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow. You all know please. That girl was hot. She's my cousin. She is. Yes, we're all cousins. Right? You're right at. Ho, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. What? Oh, shut. Ah. What do you think? He makes? Not enough? And here we have our latest advancement. The Krill. Wow. What does that do? Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour. It saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course, most be jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job if it's done well means a lot. But choose carefully because you will stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life, the same job for the rest of your life. I didn't know that. What's the difference? Huh? And you'll be happy to know that these are, the species haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death. We'll sure try. Yeah. Wow. That blew my mind. What's the difference, Adam? How could you say that one job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. Well, I'm relieved now. We only have to make one decision in life. But Adam, how could they never have told us that? Barry? Why would you question anything? We're bees? We're the most perfectly functioning society on earth. Yeah. But Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about, please clear the gate. Royal nectar. Wait a second, check it out. Those are pollen jocks. Wow. I had a good, I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like to go outside the hive. Yeah, but some of them don't come back. You sky did freak. You're monsters. You sky freaks. I love it. I love it. I wonder where those guys have just been. I don't know. Their day's not planned outside of high flying. Who knows where doing, who knows what? You can't just decide one day to be a pollen jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look at that. That's more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. Perhaps unless you're wearing it. And the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies, oh, aren't they? Our cousins? Too distant, distant. Look at these two, couple of hive. Harry. Let's have some fun with them. It must be so dangerous being a poll and, oh, yeah, one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the. Oh, no, I never thought I'd knock him out. And what were you doing during all of this? Obviously, I was trying to, the authorities. I can autograph that if you want. Little Gusty out there today, wasn't it? Comrades? Yeah. Gusty. I know we're gonna hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here tomorrow. Six miles. Huh? Barry. That's a puddle jump for us. But maybe you're not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not. We're going 900 at J gate. Whoa. What do you think? Buzzy boy? Are you big enough? I might be. It all depends on what? 0, 900 means. Oh, dad, you surprised me. Have you decided what you're interested in, son? Well, there's a lot of choices but you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day, son? Let me tell you something about stirring. You grab that stick and you just move it around and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. And you are thinking of what making balloon animals. That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Well, no, your son's not sure he wants to go into, honey. Oh, Barry. You are so funny. Sometimes I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny. You're going into, honey. Our son, the stir. You're gonna be a no one's listening to me. Wait. Do you see the sticks? I have for you. I can say anything I want right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo. Let's open some fresh honey. Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Honey. Shave my antenna. Check up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth. You start calling everybody dogs so proud you. I can't believe we're starting work today. Today's the day. Come on, all the good jobs will be gone. Yeah. Right. Pollen counting stunt fee. Boring stir front desk hair removal. Is it still available? Hang on two left and one of them's yours? Congratulations, son. Stuff to the side plays. Yeah. What'd you get? Picking the crud out? That is stellar. Wow. Couple of newbies. Yes, sir. Our first day we are ready. Well, step up and make a choice. You want to go first? Uh No, you go. Oh my. What's available? Restroom attendants always open and not for the reason. You think any chance of getting on to the men, sir? Sure you're on. Oh, I'm sorry, the crewman just closed out. Oh, wax monkey's always open and the Krelman just opened up again. What happened? Well, whenever a bee dies, that's an opening. See that he's dead dead. Another dead one. Daddy dead. 52 more. Dead, dead from the neck up, dead from the neck down. But that's life. 00, this is so hard heating, cooling. Stumpy, poorer, stir humming. Inspector. Number seven. Lint, coordinator, strip supervisor and Tim and Polisher Mike Wingler. Barry. Barry. What do you think? I should, Barry Barry. All right. We've got the sunflower man tomorrow. What happened to you? Where are you? I'm going out, out, out where, out there. Oh, no, I have to. Before I go to work for the rest of my life, you're gonna die. You're crazy. Hello? Oh, another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean Deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.

Power kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. Yeah, I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. It could be daisy. Do we need those? Don't worry. Copy that visual. Hold on. This flower seems to be on the move. Say it again. Are you reporting a moving flower? Affirmative that one. This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know what I'm loving this color.

What's your number one Star Wars? No, I don't go for that kind of stuff. No wonder we're not supposed to talk to them. They're out of their minds when I walk out of a job interview. They're flabbergasted. They can't believe the things they say. I can't really, here's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. Come on. No, I got to tell you, I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first. I thought it was just me. Stop ba and back, these are winter boots, you know? You know, I'm allergic to them. This thing could kill me. Why does his life have any less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. I brochure name girl, little guy. I'm not scared of him but, you know, it's an allergic thing. Hey, why don't you put that on your resume? Brochure? It's not funny. My old face could pop up. Hm. Make it one of your special skills, you know, knocking someone out is also a special skill, right? Vanessa next week. Yogurt day. Sure can, you know, whatever you could put Carra chips on there. Supposed to be less Callies or something. Ok. Uh, I got to say something. She saved my life. I got to say something. All right, here it goes, man. Yes. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a B law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to Oh, I can't do it. Come on. Yes. No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? You like jazz? No, that's not good. Here she comes. Speak you fool. Um, hi. I'm sorry? Yes, I know. I know. I'm so, I know, I'm so, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. No, it's ok. It's fine. Just, I know I'm dreaming but I don't recall going to bed. Well, you know, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. Yeah. I mean, this is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee. Yeah, I am a bee and, uh, you know, I'm not supposed to be doing this but they were all trying to kill me and if it wasn't for you, I mean, I, I had to thank you. It's just, it's the way I was raised. 00, that was a little weird. I'm talking to a bee. Yeah, I'm talking to a bee anyway. Then the bee is talking to me. Um, I just want you to know that I'm grateful and I'm gonna leave now. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. How did you learn to do that? What? That's like that? The talking thing? Oh, same way you did, I guess mama, dad da, honey, you pick it up. Very funny. Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh we'd cry with what we have to deal with anyway. Can I, uh, get you something like what? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Coffee. Well, uh, I don't want to put you out unless you're working anywhere. No, it takes two minutes. Just coffee. I hate to impose. That won't be ridiculous. Actually, I would love a coffee. Hey, you want a little rum cake? I really have a little rum. No, no, no, I can't. Oh, come on. You know, I'm trying to lose a couple of micrograms here where, well, these stripes don't help. You know, if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No, he's making the tie in the cab as flying up Madison. So he finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on and he says watermelon, I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon? Oh, is that, uh, a B joke? Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that we do. Yeah. So, anyway, what are you gonna do? Barry about work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. You do. Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. Really? My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Oh, Anyway, uh, you see if you look, there's my hive right there. You could see it. Oh, you're in sheet meadows. Yes. You know the turtle right off of that. Oh, no way. I know that area. Do you know? I lost the toe ring there. Really? Yes. Why do girls put rings on their toes? I don't know. It's like putting a hat on your knee. Maybe I'll try that. You are right, ma'am. Uh, oh, yeah, fine. Just having two cups of coffee. Uh, anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah. So sorry, I couldn't finish it if I did. I'd be up the rest of my life. I, um, can I, um, can I take a piece of this with me? Sure. Have a rump. Oh, thanks. All right. Well, then, uh, I guess I'll see you around or not, or? Ok, Barry. And, uh, thank you so much again for before. Oh, yeah, that was nothing. Well, not nothing but, but anyway, bye. Yeah. No, no, this can't possibly work. Well, he's all set to go. We may as well try it. Ok, Dave. Oh, that sounds amazing. It was amazing. It was the scariest happiest moment of my life. Humans, humans, I can't believe you were with humans. Giant, scary humans. What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy, giant things. They drive around real crazy and do they try and kill you like on TV? Some of them, but some of them don't. How'd you get back, Poodle? Look, you did it and I'm glad you saw whatever you wanted to see out there you had your experience and now you're back, you can pick out your job and everything can be normal. Well, well, well, well, I met someone. You met someone. Will she be? Ish? Well, not a wasp, your parents will kill you. Oh, no, no, not a wasp spider. You know, not attracted to the spiders. I know it. Everyone else. It's like the hottest thing with the eight legs and all I can't get by that face. So, uh, who is she? She's uh human. Oh, no, no, no, no. That didn't happen. You didn't do that. That's a be law. You wouldn't break a bee law. Her name's Vanessa. 00 boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist. Oh, no, no, no, no. You're dating a human florist. Well, we're not dating, you're flying outside the hive. You're talking to human beings that attack our homes with power washers and M 80 s. That's 1\/8 of a stick of dynamite. She saved my life and she understands me. This is over, eat this. This is not over. What was that? They call it? A crumb that was so stinging stripy and that's not even what they eat that just falls off what they eat. Do you know what a Cinnabon is? No, it's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up, sit down really hot. Listen to me. We are not them. We're us, there's us and there's them who can deny the heart that is yearning. There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me. You have got to start thinking, be my friend thinking, be thinking, be thinking, be thinking, ok, there he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry. I got to start thinking b Barry, how much longer is this going to go on? It's been three days. I don't understand why you're not working. Well, I've got a lot of big life decisions. I'm thinking about what life you have no life. You have no job. You're barely a bee. Would it kill you to just make a little honey. Harry, come out from under there. Your father's talking to you, Martin. Would you talk to him? I'm po I change. Got no. How to go. Very good. Got everything all set. You go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. I just keep sitting here. I just long, long. We are still here, Barry. I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond when you yell at him. Then why are you yelling at me? Because you don't listen. I'm not listening to this. Sorry mom. I've got to go. Where are you going? Nowhere? I'm meeting a friend. A girl. Is this why you can't decide? I just hope she's be ish. So they have a huge parade of just flowers every year in Pasadena. Oh, to be in the tournament of roses. That's every floor stream up on a float surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. Wow. A tournament. Do the roses actually compete in athletic events? No. All right. I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? Isn't that faster? Ok. I see. I see. All right. Your turn, uh, tivo you can just freeze live TV. That's insane. Well, you don't have anything like that. We have hio, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my dumb bees. You must just want to sting all those jerks. We really try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you really have to watch your temper. Oh yeah, very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. You work through it like any emotion, anger, jealousy, lust. Oh my goodness. Are you ok? Yeah. What is wrong with you? It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here. You creep. What was that? A pick and save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know like about 10 pages? 75 is pretty much our limit.

Ray Liotta Private Select. You see that actor? I never heard of him. Why is this here for people we eat it. Why you don't have enough food of your own. Well, yes. How do you even get it? Will bees make it? I know who makes it and it's hard to make it. There's heating and cool and stirring. You need a whole Krovi thing. It's organic, it's organic. It's just honey berry. Just what bees don't know about this. This is stealing a lot of stealing. You've taken our homes, our schools, our hospitals. This is all we have and it's on sale. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. I'm gonna get to the bottom of all of this. Oh, hey Hector, you're almost done almost. He is here. I sense it. Ok. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out with no one around. You're a bustard box. Boy, I knew I heard something so you can talk. Oh, I can talk and now you're gonna start talking. Where are you getting all the sweet stuff? Who's your wire? I don't know what you're talking about. I thought we were all friends. The last thing we want to do is upset. Any of you, please. You're too late. He does. Now you sir have crossed the wrong sword. You sir are about to be lunch from Iguana. You where is the honey coming from? Tell me where honey farms. He goes from honey farms. Wow. Ah yeah. Oh, can see. Yeah. Hm. Bye bye. No, bye. Oh my. What horrible thing has happened here. Look at these faces, they never know what hit them and now they're on the road to nowhere. Just keep still what you're not dead. Do I look dead? Hey, man, they will wipe anything that moves. Now, where are you heading to? Honey Farms? I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska Moose blood crazy stuff. Close your head off. I've got one that's a coma. What about you? He really is dead. All right. Uh What is that? Oh no, it's a wiper, triple blade, triple blade jump on its own. Why does everything have to be so dumb, please? How much do you people need to see?

Oh, what's up? B boy? Hey, blood. And it was just an endless row of honey jars as far as the eye could see. Wow. So I'm just assuming wherever this honey truck goes, that's where they're getting it. I mean not honey's ours. Bees hang tight. Well, we're all jammed in there. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito owner. But what if you get in trouble? Trouble you a mosquito. You in trouble. Nobody likes it. That's all smacking people. See a mosquito smack smack. At least you're out in the world. You must meet a lot of girls, mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moss dragonfly mosquito girl. Don't want no mosquito. Who you got to be? Kidding me? Moose. Blood's about to leave the building so long be hang out. Do I catch y'all down here? Did you bring your crazy stuff? Then we throw it in some jars. Slap a label on it and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads. Yeah. Hey, check out the new smoker. Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000 smoker. 90 puffs a minute. Semiautomatic twice. The nicotine, all the tar, couple of breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey and we make the money. They make the honey and we make the money. Oh my. What's going on? Are you? Ok? Yeah, it doesn't last too long. How did all these bees get here? Do you know you're in a fake hide with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen. That's a man and woman's clothes. That's a drag queen. What is this? Oh, no, there's hundreds of them be honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale. This is worse than anything the bears have done to us and I intend to do something about it. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you that humans are taking our honey? That's just a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos, Barry, how did you get mixed up in all this? Because he's been talking to humans, talking to humans. He has a human girlfriend and they make out make out Barry. We do not. You wish you could? Whose side are you on the bees? I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Man. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. How Chia Barry? This is what you want to do with your life. This is what I want to do for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees. Dad. I remember you coming home some nights so overworked, your hands were still stirring. Your, wouldn't stop em. I remember that. What right. Do they have to, our hard earned honey. We're living on two cups a year. They're putting it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever. Even if it's true, Barry, what could one be do? I'm gonna sting them where it really hurts in the face. No, in the eye that would really hurt. No, up the nose. That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans. One place where it really matters. Hive at five. Holy full power with Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with storm singers, sports with Buzz Larvey and Jeannette Chuk. Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble and I'm Jeannette our top story. A tri county be Barry Benson is saying he intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey packaging it and profiting from it illegally. Don't forget tomorrow night on B Larry King, we're gonna have three former queens. All right, here in our studio discussing their new book, classy ladies out this week on Hexagon tonight, we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think I'm just a kid from the hive. I can't do this. Larry Bees have never been afraid to change the world. I mean, what about B Columbia? Be Gandhi for Jesus? Well, where I'm from, you wouldn't think of suing humans. We were thinking more like stickball candy stores. How old are you? I want you to know that the entire bee community is supporting you in this case, which is certain to be the trial of the bee century. Thank you, Larry. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name next week on Be Larry King. No, no. I mean, he looks like you and he has a show with suspenders and different colored dots behind him next week on B Larry King. Eye glasses and there's quotes along the bottom from the guest you're watching even though you just heard him barely next week, they're scary. They're hairy and they're here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders. Squinty eyes. Very Jewish. Look in tennis. You attack a point of weakness, but it was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey. Her backhand's a joke. I'm not gonna take advantage of that quiet. Please. Actual work going on here. Is that that same bee? Yes, it is. I'm helping him sue the human race. What? Oh, hello. Hello Bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland size 10.5 Vibram soul, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go cause we're really busy working but it's our yogurt night. Bye bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult? Oh, you poor thing. You two have been at this for hours. Yes. And Adam here has been a huge help. Frosting. How many sugars? Just one? I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Anyway, bees have good qualities seed and it feels good to take my mind off the shop. I don't know why, but instead of flowers, people are given balloon bouquets now. Yeah, those are great if you're three and artificial flowers. Oh, those just get me psychotic. Yeah, me too. Defense stingers. The pointless pollination bees must hate those fake plastic things. There's nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Well. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit, you know, Barry, this lawsuit's a pretty big deal, I guess. Are you sure that you want to go through with it? Am I sure when I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say honey, I'm home without paying a royalty. It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan where all eyes and ears of the world are anxiously waiting because for the first time in history we're going to hear for ourselves. If a honey bee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here? Barry? I don't know. But it's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't have to be at work during the day. Hey, you think these billion dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Yeah. What's the matter? I don't know. I just got to chill. Well, if it is the B team of you boys work on this all rise. The honorable judge Bumble presiding. All right. Case number 44 75 Superior Court of New York. Barry B. Benson versus the honey industry is now in session, Mr Montgomery. You're representing the five major food companies collectively a privilege. Uh Mr Vinson, you're representing all bees of the world. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Yes, your honor. We're ready to proceed. And Mr Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the Jura, my grandmother was a simple woman born on a farm. She believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature. Gada put before us if we were to live in the top seat of the world. Mr Benson, imagines ju ju ju just think of what it would mean. Maybe I, I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my bris talking bee. How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion picture capture Hollywood wizardry. They could be using laser bees, robotics. Ventriloquism are cloning for all we know he could be on steroids. Mr Vincent. No, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee and as a bee, honey is pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it. We make it and we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us because we're the little guys. And what I'm hoping is that after this is all over, you'll see how by taking our honey you're not only taking away everything we have but everything we are. Oh, I wish you would dress like that all the time. So nice. Call your first witness. So Mr Klaus Vader Hayden of Honey farms. Pretty big company you have there. I suppose so. And I see you also own honey. Burton and Huron. Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I have to say, I don't imagine you employ any bee freer, do you? No, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. No. No, because you don't free bees. You keep bees and not only that it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. Well, they're very lovable creatures. A yogi bear. Fozzie bear. Build a bear. Yeah. You mean like this bears kill bees? How would you like his big hairy head crashing through your living room biting into your couch, spitting out, you throw pillows. Ok. That's enough. Take him away. So Mr Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. I have to say, where have I heard it before? I was with a band called the police, but you've never been a police officer of any kind, have you? Uh No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture being casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prince about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung Mr Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung sting or should I say Mr Gordon M Sumner? Not his real name. You here, Mr Liotta 1st May I offer my belated? Congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on er, in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I also see from your resume that you're Devilishly handsome but with a churning inner turmoil that's always ready to blow. I enjoy. What I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you Mr Liotta exploiting tiny helpless bees? So you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines sir. Watch it. Benson. I could blow right now. This isn't a good fella. This is a bad fella. Someone just step on this little creep. We can all go home, order, order in this, taking it order. What do I say? Please sit down. Well, I just think it was awfully nice of that. Bear to pitch in like that. I'm telling you. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything Right. You know, legally, I'm a florist. Right. Right. Well, here's to a great team, to a great team. Well, hello. Oh, Ken. Hello. Uh, I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call but the battery, I didn't want all this to go to waste. So I called Barry. Luckily he was free. Yeah. Oh, that was lucky. Well, there's still a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up. Sure. Whatever. So, I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. I find the ball a little grabby. That's where I usually sit right there. Hm. Barry was looking at your resume and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill, you think? I don't see what you're doing. Hey, look, I know how hard it is. Trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. Do we? Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the rut out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. I borrow your razor for his buzz. I hope that was all right. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna go drain the old stinger. Yeah. You do that? Oh, come on. 00. You know, you know, I just about had it with your little mind games. What's that? Italian Vogue mama here. That's a lot of pages. It's a lot of ads. Remember what Vance said? Why is your life any more valuable than mine? That's funny. I just can't seem to recall that. I think something stinks in here. I love the smell of flowers. Yeah. How do you like the smell of flames? Not as much. Mhm. Oh. 000. Water bug. Not take it side. Hey, look at me. I'm wearing a chapstick hat. This is pathetic. I've got a issue. Oh, well, well, well, a royal flush. You're bluffing. Ever go. Yeah, there's a water. Who that bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings. What are you doing? You know what? I don't even like honey. I don't eat it. We need to talk. He's just a little bee and he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time. Long time. What are you talking about? Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life and you're one of them fine talking bees? No, yogurt night. My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster. Good bye, Ken. Oh, and for your information, I prefer sugar free artificial sweeteners made by, man. I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste. I like it. I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well, are you gonna be ok for the trial tomorrow? Oh, I believe Mr Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr Barry Benson B to the stand. Now, that's a good idea. You can really see why he's considered one of the very best lawyers. Leighton. You've got to weave some magic with this jury or it's gonna be all over. Oh, don't worry, Mr Gamble. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. You got the tweezers? Are you allergic? Only to losing son? Only to losing Mr Benson. D, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. Good friends. Yes. How good do you live together? Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is about her little bed bug that I seen a bee document her into. Now, from what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee Children in the hives? Yeah. So those aren't even your real parents? Oh, Barry. Yes, they are. Hold me back. You are an illegitimate bee, aren't you Benson? He's denouncing bees. And don't y'all ain't your cousins objection? I'm gonna pin cushion this guy, Adam down to 20 ones. Yeah. Yeah. The venom venom is causing my failed by a winged beast of destruction. You see, you can't treat a black equals. They're stripping savages. Singing's the only thing they know it's their way. Adam stay with me. I can't feel my legs. Oh Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my healing. But I will have my order, please. The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal teams, Stone Leighton T Montgomery. Now here's, hey, buddy. Hey, so much pain. Yeah. A a I blew the whole case, didn't I? Oh, it doesn't matter. The important thing is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs and a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all, all adrenaline and then, and then ecstasy. Hm. All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry, I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What do you think? The humans will do to us if they win. I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in but they don't check out. Oh, my say. Could you uh get a nurse to close that window? Why the smoke bees don't smoke? Right. Please don't smoke. Bees don't smoke. But some bees are smoking. Adam, that's it. That's our case. It is. It's not over. No, get up, get dressed. I've got to go somewhere. You get back to the court and stall, stall any way you can and assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub. Like look Mr Flamen. Yes. Yes. Yes. Your honor. Where is the rest of your team? Uh Well, well, your honor. It's interesting, you know, bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often, we don't make very good time. Actually, once heard a pretty funny story about him on haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. Mr Flamen. I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr Montgomery's motion, but you can't, we have a terrific case. Where's your proof? Where's the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Hold it your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun? What is that? It's a bee smoker. What is this harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly a little or a bee members of the jury? Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked smoking or non. Is this what nature intended for us to be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines and man made wooden slat work camps living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man. What are we gonna do is play the species card? Ladies and gentlemen, please bring these bees. Happy, happy. The court finds in favor of the Vanessa. We won. No, you can do it. I, oh, sorry. I'm ok. Vanessa. Do you know what this means? All the honey is finally gonna belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature. Vinson. You'll regret this, Barry. How much honey do you think it's all right? All right. Uh One at a time, Barry, who are you wearing? Uh my sweaters, Ralph Lauren and I have no pants. What if Montgomery's right? What do you mean? We've been living the B way a long time? 27 million years. Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement first? We're going to demand a complete shutdown of all B work camps. Then we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy smelly, big headed bad breath stink machine. I believe we're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take them out. Yeah, we'll have a little nausea for a few hours and it'll be fine and we will no longer tolerate derogatory b negative nicknames. But it's just a about stage name, unnecessary inclusion of honey and bogus health products and la da human tea time snack garnishments. Do it. You can't breathe. Bring it in boys do perfect. Sp Mr Buswell. We just pass three cups and this gallon sports coming I think we need to shut down, shut down. We'd never shut down, shut down, honey. Production. Stop making honey. Turn your key, sir. Well, what do we do now? Hm. Hm. Cannonball. Ah, by shutting down honey. Production on boarding, pollination and nectar detail returning to base. So, Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah. What's going on around here? Where is everybody? Are they out celebrating? No, they're just home. They don't know what to do. They're laying out, they're sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio for the cricket. At least we got our honey back. Yeah, but sometimes I think so. What if the humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world. I was excited to be a part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now, no, I can't, I don't understand why they're not happy. We have so much now. I thought their lives would be better. They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey. Really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on. Do you? What did you want to show me this? Oh, what happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees, bees specifically me, I guess they didn't think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. It's not just flowers, fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. Well, that's our whole sat test right there. So you take away the produce that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then of course the human species. Yeah. So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? And I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? I'll sting you. You step on me that just kills you twice. Listen, Barry, sorry. But I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa. Why are you leaving? Where are you going to the final tournament of Rosa's parade in Pasadena? They've moved it up to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa. I just want to say, I'm sorry, I never meant it to turn out like this. I know me neither. Tournament of roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses, roses, roses. Been road berry roaster flowers. Yes, they are. Flowers, bees pollen. I know that's why this is the last play. Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down? Could you slow down? Oh, ok. I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster and it's all my fault. Yes. It kind of is. I've ruined the planet and I wanted to help you with your flower shop instead. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling nonetheless. I have another idea and it's greater than all my previous great ideas combined. I don't want to hear it. All right. Here's what I'm thinking. They have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee plant and flower bud in this park. All we got to do is get what they've got back here with what we've got bees, pork pollen, flower pollination. All right. Tournament of roses. Pasadena, California. They got nothing but flowers floats and cotton candy security. Will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloom FTD. Official floral business. Oh, it's real sorry, ma'am. That's a nice broach, by the way. Thank you. It was a gift. Then once we're inside we just pick the right float. How about the princess and the peas? I could be the princess and you could be. I think I got it. Sorry, I'm late. Where should I sit? Where you? I believe I'm the p the p it's supposed to be under the mattresses. Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. I'm gonna go talk to the marshal. You do that? This whole parade is a fiasco. Let's see what this baby will do do it. Then all we do is blend in with trapping without arousing suspicion. And once we're at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop security. Did you? And your insect pack? Your own float. Has the float been in your possession the entire time? Yes. Would you remove your shoes and everything in your pockets? Can you remove your stinger, sir? Um, that's part of me. I, no, just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. And then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job. I think this is gonna work. Vanessa. It's got to work attention passengers. This is Captain Scott. I'm afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York. Area and it looks like we're going to be experiencing a couple of hours delay. Mary. These are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I got to get up there and talk to these guys. Be careful. Hey, can I get some help with this Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable ear and nose hair trimmer. Excuse me, Captain. I'm in a real situation here. What'd you say? How? I didn't say anything? Oh, no, no, don't freak out. There's a chance my entire space three. Yeah. What are you doing? Oh, wait a minute. I'm an attorney who's an attorney? Don't know. Ok. Poor berry. Good afternoon passengers. This is your captain speaking. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloom and 24 B, please report to the cockpit and please. All right. What happened here? I tried to talk to them but then there was a Dustbuster, a toupee. A life raft exploded. Now, one's bald, one's in a boat and they're both unconscious. They're not a B joke. No, no one's flying the plane. This is JFK Control Tower flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Blue. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious and so is the co pilot not good. Is there anyone on board who experience? As a matter of fact, there is. Who's that Barry Benson from the honey trial? Oh, great. Vanessa. This is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. Why not? Is it John Travolta pilot? Yes. How hard could it be? Wait a minute, Barry, we're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late breaking news from JFK airport where a very suspenseful scene is developing Barry Benson. Fresh off his stunning legal victory bar is now attempting to land a plane loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers. We have an electrical storm in the area and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience just a minute. Mr Ditch water. There's a honey bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr Benson's work and there's no account of Padres. Haven't they done enough damage already? Isn't he? Your only hope right now? Come on. Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. The wings are too small. Their bodies are too big. Hold on a second. Haven't we heard this a million times? The surface area? The wings and the body mass doesn't make sense. Get this on the air. You got it. We're going live water the way we work may be a mystery to you because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job if you do it really well, it makes a big difference more than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best, working together. That's the b way we're not made of Jell O. We get behind a fellow black and yellow left, right down. Hover, hover, forget hover. You know what? This isn't so hard. Beep, beep Mary. What happened? Wait a minute. I think we're on autopilot that whole time. That may have been helping me. Uh no, we're not. It turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you. Let's get behind us full up. Moving on. Our only chance is if I do what I would do and you copy me with the wings of the plane, you don't have to yell. I'm not yelling. We happen to be in a lot of trouble here. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice. It's not a tone. I'm panicking. I don't think I could do this. Vanessa pull yourself together. Listen to me. You have got to snap out of it. You snap out of it. You snap out of it. You, no, you snap out of it. You step out, hold it. Oh, come on. It's my turn. How's the plane flying? I don't know. Hello. Hey, Vincent. Have you got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? Paul and talks. They do get behind a fellow black and yellow. Hello? All right. You to, what do you say? We dropped this? 10 can on the black top. What? Black top where I can't see anything, can you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Come on. You gotta think. B Barry thinking BB. Hey, wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. What? I don't know, but it's strong and it's pulling me like a 27 million year old instinct. Bring the nose of the plane down. What in the world is on the tarmac? Get some lights on that. Vanessa ain't for the flower. OK. Cut the, cut the engine. We're going in on b Power ready boys. Affirmative, good, good, easy. Now that's it. Plan on that flower. You ready boys all reverse it around. Not that flower, the other flower which flow flow the flow. That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating flower made of millions of bees. Pull forward, nose down. Bring your tail up, rotate around it. Oh, this is, this is the only way I know how to fly. Am I cuckoo kau? Or is this plane flying in an insect like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid of it. Smell it. Clear it earth easy. Just drop it. Be part of it. Hey, now, drop it in woman. Yeah. Come on already. We did it. You taught me how to fly. Yes. No, I five. Right. Barry it worked. Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower. That was genius, man. Genius. Thank you. But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're going to survive as a species, this is our moment. So, what do you all say? Are we going to be these or just Museum of Natural History? Key chains, key chain, then follow me. Except key chain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've burned this. Yeah, I'm a pollen jock and it's a perfect fish. All I gotta do with the sleeves. Oh, yeah, that's our berry. Here comes the, so here comes this. Hey, it's all right. Is, it's the faces. It's, it's a, anybody needs to make a call. Now is the time I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight. You, you should change and have a great afternoon. Can I help? Who's next? Who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is. Be approved. Oh, don't forget these milk cream cheese. It's all me and I don't see a nickel. Uh huh. Uh huh. Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat. I had no idea. Barry. I'm sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you? Excuse me? My mosquito associate here will be able to help you. Sorry, I'm late. He's a lawyer too, ma'am. I was already a blood sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon, Barry. I just got this huge tula reporter for a wedding and I can't get them anywhere. No problem. Fanny. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver. Barry? Can I help who's next? All right. Scramble jocks. It's time to fly. Thank you. Oh, that bee is living my life. Let it go. Kenny. When will this nightmare end? Beautiful day to fly. It sure is between you and me. I was dying to get out of that office. Yeah, I do. Ok. Yeah. Oh, you have got to start thinking, be my friend. Thinking, be me thinking, thinking, thinking here and buzzing there. I'm loving the views. Listen to me cousin. Every buzzer must use to be a bee or not to be me. Now, you've got no occupation. What do you mean like pollination? Now? That's thinking, be, listen to me fella. Ain't your pin on the tour? Can you straight are black and yellow? I just want to be sure to be a bee. Can I wait and see? Be a busy little, be a little be, hold it, hold it, hold it. Let's just stop for a second. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Everyone. Can we stop here? Oh, Barry. Look, I'm not making a major life decision in the middle of a huge musical production. All right. All right. Take ted everybody wrap it up guys. I had virtually no rehearsal. For that?
