 me the smoking gun hold it your hononner you want a smoking gun here is your smoking gun what is that its a b smoker what this this harmless little contraption this couldnt hurt a fly a little older be members of the jury look at what has happened to bees
 who have never been asked smoking or non is this what nature intended for us to be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines and manmade wooden slat work camps living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man what are we going to do its playing the species card ladies and gentlemen please free these bees
 free the beast free the beast free the beast the court in favor of the beast vanessa we won yay i knew you could do it highvive oh sorry im okay vanessa do you know what this means all the honey is finally going to belong to the bees now we wont have to work so hard all the time this is an unholy perversion of the balance of nacho benson
 youll regret this barry how much honey do you think is up all right all right uh one at a time barry who are you wearing uh my sweaters ralph lauren and i have no pants what if montgomerys right what do you mean weve been living the bway a long time 27 million years congratulations on your victory what are you going to demand as a settlement first were going to demand a complete shutdown of all be work camps
 then we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with every last drop we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy smelly bigheaded bad breath stink machine
 i believe were all aware of what they do in the woods wait for my signal take them out well have a little nauja for a few hours then itll be fine and we will no longer tolerate derogatory be negative nicknames but its just a prance about stage name unnecessary inclusion of honey and fogus health products and ladida human teatime snack garnishments cant breathe
 bring it in boys hold it right there good mr buss well we just passed three cups and this galance mores coming i think we need to shut down shut down weve never shut down shut down honey production stop making honey
 turn your keys sir what are we do now cannonball
 were shutting down honey production mission of board boarding pollination and nectar detail returning the base
 adam you wouldnt believe how much honey was out there oh yeah whats going
 what going on around here where is everybody are they out celebrating no theyre just home they dont what to do theyre laying out theyre sleeping in i heard your uncle carl was on his way to san antonio with a cricket at least we got our honey back yeah but sometimes i think so what if the humans liked our honey who wouldnt its the greatest thing in the world i was excited to be a part of making it this was my new desk this was my new job i wanted to do it really well and now
 now i cant i dont understand why theyre not happy we have so much now i thought their lives would be better theyre doing nothing its amazing honey really changes people you dont have any idea whats going on do you what did you want to show me this
 what happened here that is not the half of it oh no oh my theyre all wilting doesnt look very good does it no and whose fault do you think that is you know im going to guess bees bees specifically me i guess i didnt think that bees
 not needing to make honey would affect all these other things its not just flowers fruits vegetables they all need bees oh thats a whole sat test right there so you take away the produce that affects the entire animal kingdom and then of course the human species so if theres no more pollination it could all just go south here couldnt it and i know this is also partly my fault
 how about a suicide pact how would we do it ill stang you you step on me that just kills you twice right listen barry sorry but i got to get going i had to open my mouth and talk vanessa
