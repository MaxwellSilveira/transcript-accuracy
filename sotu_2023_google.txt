 the house of representatives nancy colosy folks the story of america is a story of progress and resilience of always moving forward of never ever giving up its a story unique among all nations
 were the only country that has emerged from every crisis weve ever entered stronger than we got into it look folks thats what were doing again two years ago the economy was reeling i stand here tonight after weve created with the help of many people in this room 12 million new jobs more jobs created in two years any presents created in 4 years because of you all american people 
 two years ago in two years ago covid had shut down our businesses were closed our schools were robbed of so much and today covid no longer controls our lives and two years ago democracy faced its greatest threats in civil war and today though bruised our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken
 as we gather here tonight were reading the next chapter in the great american story a story of progress and resilience when world leaders ask me to define america and they do believe it or not i say i can define it in one word and i mean this possibilities we dont think anything is beyond our capacity everything is a possibility
 you know were often told that democrats and republicans cant work together but over the past two years we proved the synics and the sayers wrong yes we disagreed plenty and yes there were times the democrats went alone but time and again democrats and republicans came together came together to defend a stronger and safer europe it came together to pass one in the one in a generation once in a generation infrastructure law building bridges connecting our nation and our people
 we came together to pass the most significant law ever helping victims expose the toxic burn pits and
 is important in fact i signed over 300 bipartisant pieces of legislation since becoming president from reauthorizing the violence against women act the electoral count reform act the respect for marriage act the protects the right to marry the person you love and to my republican friends if we could work together the last congress is
 reason we cant work together and find consensus on important things in this congress as well i think folks you all are as formed as i am but i think the people send us a clear message fighting for the sake of fighting power for the sake of power conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere thats always
 than my vision of our country and its many of yours to restore the soul of this nation to rebuild the backbone of america americas middle class and to unite the country weve been sent here to finish the job in my view for decades the middle class has been holowed out and more than and not no one administration but for a long time too many good pain manufacturing jobs move overseas factories closed down once thriving cities and towns many of you represent became shatter
 of what they used to be along the way something else we lost pride our sense of selfworth i ran for president to fundamentally change things to make sure or economy works for everyone so we can all feel that pride and what we do to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down because when the middle class does well the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well we all do well
 i know a lot of you always kid me for always quoting my dad but my dad used to say joey a jobs about a lot more than a paycheck is it really would say this its about a lot more than a paycheck its about your dignity its about respect its about being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey its going to be okay and mean it well folks so lets look at the
 results were not finished yet by any stretching imagination but unemployment rate is at 3.4 of 50 year low near record a near record unemployment near record unemployment for black and hispanic workers weve already created your help 800,000 good paying manufacturing jobs the fastest growth and
 years and where is it written where is it written that america cant lead the world of manufacturing i dont where thats written for too many decades we imported projects and exported jobs now thanks to what youve all done were exporting american products and creating american jobs inflation inflation has been a
 global problem because the pandemic disrupted our supply chains and putins unfair and brutal war in ukraine disrupted energy supplies as well as food supplies blocking all that grain in ukraine but were better position any country on earth right now but we have more to do but here at home inflation is coming down here at home gas prices are down $150 from their peak food inflation is coming down not fast enough but coming down
 has fallen every month for the last months all up the last two years a record 10 million americans apply to start new businesses 10 million by the way every time someone starts in small businesses an act of hope and madam vice president i want to thank you
 for leading that effort to ensure the small business have access to capital and the historic laws we enacted that are going to just come into being standing here last year i shared with you a story of american genius and possibilities semiconductors small computer chips the size of a fingerprint to power everything from cellpones to automobiles and so much more these chips were invented in america lets get that straight they were invented in america
 we used to make 40 of the worlds chips in the last several decades we lost our edge were down to only producing 10 we all saw what happened to
 during the pandemic when chip factories shut down overseas todays automobiles need 3 chips each of those automobiles but american automobiles couldnt make enough cars because there werent enough chips car prices went up people got laid off so did everything from refrigerators to cell phones we can never let that happen again thats why thats why we came together to pass the bipartisan chips and science act
 folks i know ive been criticized for saying this but im not changing my view were going to make sure the supply chain for america begins in america the supply chain begins in america weve already created
 weve already created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs without this law before the law get kicks in with this new law were going to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country and mean all across the country throughout not just the coast but through the middle of the country as well thats going to come from companies that have announce more than $300 billion dollars in investment in american manufacturing over the
 next few years outside of columbus ohio intel is building semiconductor factories on a thous acres literally a field of dreams its going to create 10,000 jobs at one investment 7,000 construction jobs 3,000 jobs in those factories once theyre finished they call them factors jobs paying an average of $130,000 a year and many do not require a college degree
 jobs because we work together these jobs where people dont have to leave home to search for opportunity its just getting started think about the new homes the small businesses the big the mediumsized businesses so much more thats going to be needed to support those 3 those 3,000 permanent jobs and the factories that are going to be built
 talk to mayors and governors democrats and republicans and theyll tell you what this means for their communities were seen these field of dreams transform to the heartland but to maintain the strongest economy in the world we need the best infrastructure in the world folks as you all know we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure
 weve sunk to 13th in the world the united states of america 13th in the world in infrastructure modern infrastructure but now were coming back because we came together and passed the bis infrastructure law the largest investment infrastructure since president nice howers interstate highway system folks already we
 we funded over 20,000 projects including major airports from boston to atlanta to portland projects we going to put thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways our bridges our railroads our tunnels ports airports clean water highspeed internet all across america urban rural tribal and folks were just getting started were just getting started and i mean you sincerely
 i want to thank my republican friends who voted for the law and my republican friends who voted against it as well but im still i i still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well but dont worry i promised id be a president for all americans well fund these projects and ill see you with the groundbreaking look this law
 this law will further unite all of america projects like brent spent bridge in kentucky over the ohio river built 60 years ago badly needed repairs one of the nations most congested freight rots carrying two billion of the freight every single day across the ohio river and folks been talking about fixing it for decades but were really finally going to get it done i went there last month with democrats and republic
 and from both states to deliver a commitment of $1.6 billion for this project while i was there i met
 young woman named sarah whos here tonight i dont where sarah is is she up in the box i dont sarah how are you well sarah for 30 years for 30 years i learned she told me shed been a proud member of the iron workers local 44 known as known as the cowboys in the sky
 the folks who built built cincinnati skyline sarah said she cant wait to be 10 stories above the ohio river building that new bridge god bless her thats pride and thats were also building were building back pride look were also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes in america 400,000 school and child care centers so every child in america
 every child american drink the water instead of having permanent damage to their brain look were making sure were making sure that every community every community in america has access to affordable highspeed internet no parents should have to drive by mcdonalds parking lot to help the do their homework online with their kids which many thousands were doing across the
 country and when we do these projects and again i get criticized i make no excuses for it were going to buy american were going to buy america and its totally its totally consistent with international trade rules by america has been the law since 1933 but for too long pass administration is democrat and republican
 and fought to get around it not anymore tonight im announcing new standards require all construction materials using federal infrastructure projects to be made in america made in america i mean it lumber glass drywall fiberocted cable
 and on my watch american roads bridges and american highways are going to be made with american products as well folks my economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten so many of you listen to me tonight i know you feel it so many of you felt like youve just simply been forgotten made the academic people of the past four decades too many people have been left behind and treat it like theyre invisible maybe thats
 watching from home remember the jobs that went away you remember them dont you the folks at home remember them you wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away well thats why i get that thats why were building an economy where no ones left behind jobs are coming back pride is coming back because choices we made in the last several
 years you this is my view a blue collar blunt to rebuild america make a real difference in your lives at home for example too many of you lay in bed at night like my dad did staring at the ceiling wondering what in god names happens if if your spouse gets cancer or your child gets deadly ill or something happens to you
 what are you going to get money to pay for those medical bills are you going to have to sell the house or try to get a second mortgage on it i get it i it signed in a law were taking on powerful interest to bring healthcare so you can sleep better at night with more security you pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world we say it again we pay more for
 $10 of viile to make that insulin packaging and all you may get up to $13 but big farmer has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars four to $500 a month
 making record record profits not anymore not anymore so so many things that we did are only now coming to fruition
 we said we were doing this and we said we passed the law to do it but people didnt know because the law didnt take effect until january 1 of this year we caped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on medicare people are just finding out im sure youre getting the same calls im getting look there are millions of other americans who do not or are not
 medicare including 200,000 young people with type one diabetes need this insulin to stay alive lets finish the job this time lets cap the cost of ins for everybody at $35 folks big former still going to do very well i promise you all
 i promise you theyre going to do very well this law also caps effect 2025 out of pocket drugs for seniors on medicare at a maximum of $200 year you dont have to pay more than 2 no matter how much your drugs are because you you like my family have cancer you the drugs can range from
 for the cancer drugs if drug prices rise fast inflation drug companies are going to have to pay medicare back the difference were finally were finally giving medicare the power to negotiate drug prices bringing down bringing down prescription money it cuts the federal deficit
 by billions of dollars by hundreds of billions of dollars because these prescription drugs are drugs purchased by medicare to make keep their commitment to the seniors well guess what instead of paying f or 500 bucks a month youre paying 15 thats a lot of savings for the federal government and by the way why would we want that now some members here are threatening and i
 its not a official party position so im not going to exaggerate but certainly to repeal the inflation reduction act as my coach thats okay thats fair as my football coach used to say lots of luck in your senior year make no mistake if you try anything to raise the cost of pricing jobs i will veto it
 im praised to say the more americans have health insurance now than ever in history a record 16 million people are rolled in the affordable care act and thanks thanks to the law i signed last year saving millions or saving $800 a year on their premiums and by the way that law was written in the
 benefit expires in 2025 so my ple to some of you at least in this audience lets finish the job and make these savings permanent expand coverage of medicaid look the inflation reduction act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change ever
 lowering utility bills creating american jobs leading the world to a clean energy future i visited the devastating aftermath of record floods droughts storms and wildfires from arizona to mexico to all the way up to the canadian border more timber has been burned ive observed from helicopters than the entire state of missouri and we dont have global warming not a problem in addition to emergency recovery from puerto rico to
 at idaho were rebuilding for the long term new electric grids that are able to weather major storms and not prevent those fire forest fires roads and water system will stand the next big flood
 clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs and communities often left behind were going to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of ibw workers and for helping families save more than $1,000 year with tax credits to purchase electric vehicles and efficient and efficient appliances energy efficient appliances historic conservation efforts to responsible
 stewards of our land lets face reality the climate crisis doesnt care if youre in a red or blue state its an existential threat we have an obligation not to ourselves with our children and grandchildren to confront it im proud of how how america at last is stepping up to the challenge were still going to need oil and gas for a while but guess what no we do
 but theres so much more to do we got to finish the job we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share just begin look im a capitalist im a capitalist but pay your fair share i think a lot of you at home a lot
 you at home agree with me and many people that you know the tax system is not fair it is not fair look the idea that in 2020 55 of the largest corporations in america the fortune 500 made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal taxes
 zero folks its simply not fair but now because of the law i signed billion dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15 god love them 15 thats less than a nurse pays let me be crystal clear i said at the very beginning under my plans as long as im president nobody earning less than
 $400ous will pay an additional penny in taxes nobody not one penny but lets finish the job theres more to do we have to reward work not just wealth pass my proposal for the billionaire minimum tax you know theres a thousand billionaires in america its up from about 600 and beginning of but no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than the school teacher of
 fire fighter i mean it think about it i mean i enthusiastic about that but think about it think about it have you noticed big oil just reported his profits record profits last year they made 200
 billion dollars in the midst of a global energy crisis i think its outrageous why they invested too little of that profit increase domestic production and when i talked to a couple of them they say were afraid youre going to shut down all the oil wells all the uh oil refineries anyway so why should we invest in them i said were going to need oil for at least another decade and thats going to exceed and beyond that were going to need it
 production if they had in fact invested in the production to keep gas prices down instead they use the record profits to buy back their own stock rewarding the ceos and shareholders corporations are to do the right thing thats why i propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long longterm investments theyll still make considerable profit
 lets finish the job and close the loofas allow very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes instead of cutting the number of audits for wealthy taxpayers i just signed the law to reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats thats being fiscally responsible in the last two years my administration has cut the deficit by more than one
 trillion the largest deficit reduction in american history under the previous administration
 because those record deficits no president added more than the national debt in any four years than my predecessor nearly 25 of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone the last one there the facts check it out check it out how did congress respond to that debt they did the right thing they leftted the de
 ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis they paid american bill to prevent an economic disaster to the country so tonight im asking the congress to follow suit lets commit here tonight to the full face and credit of the united states of america will never ever be questioned so my many of some of my republican friends want to take the economy hostage i get it unless i agree to their economic plans all of you at home
 should know what those plans are instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share some republicans some republicans want medicare and social security to sunset im not saying its a majority let me give you anybody who doubts it contact my office ill give you a copy ill give you a copy of the proposal that means congress doesnt vote
 glad to see you i tell you i enjoy conversion you know it means if if congress doesnt keep the programs the way they are they go away other republicans say im not saying its a majority of you i dont even think its even a significant but its being proposed by individuals im not politely not naming them but its being proposed by some of you look folks the idea is
 that were not going to be we were not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the dead if we dont respond folks so folks as we all apparently agree social security and medicare is off the off the books now right theyre not to be
 all right we got unanimity social secure and medicare a lifeline for millions of seniors americans have to pay into them from the very first paycheck they started so tonight lets all agree and we apparently are lets stand up for seniors
 stand up and show them will not cut social security we will not cut medicare those benefits belong to the american people they earned it and if anyone tries to cut social security which apparently no ones going to do and if anyone tries to stop medicare ill stop them ill veto it and b im not going to allow them to take away be taken away not today not tomorrow not every but apparently
 its not going to be a problem next month when i offer my fiscal plan i asked my republican friends to lay down their plan as well i really mean it lets sit down together and discuss our mutual plans together lets do that i can tell you the plan im going to show you going to cut
 the deficit by another trillion dollars and it wont cut a single bit of medicare or social security in fact were going to extend the medicare trust fund at least two decades buse thats going to be the next argument how do we make keep it solvent right well well not raise tax anyone making under 400 grand but well pay for it the way we talked about by making sure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share look look look here heres a deal theyre just taking advantage
 to the tax code the taking advantage you the american consumer heres my message to all of you out there i have your back were already preventing americans from receiving surprise medical bills stopping $ billion surprise bills per month so far were protecting seniors life savings by cracking down the nursing homes that commit fraud and danger patient safety prescribe drugs that are not needed millions of
 americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get a hearing aid over the counter without a prescription look capitalism
 without competition is not capitalism its extortion its exploitation last year i cracked down with the help of many of you on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for every good coming in the country i signed to buy partis and bill to cut shipping cost by 90 helping american farmers businessmen and consumers lets finish the job pass the bipartisant legislation of strengthen to strengthen and trust enforcement and for b and
 prevent big online platforms giving their own products an unfair of advantage my administration is also taking on junk fees those hidden surcharges too many companies used to make you pay more for example were making airlines show you the full ticket price up front refund your money if your flight is canceled or delayed
 we reduced exorbitant bank overdrafts by saving consumers more than $1 billion a year for cutting credit card late fees by 75 from $30 to $8 look jump fees may not matter to the very wealthy but they matter to most other folks in homes like the one i grew up in like many of you did they add up to hundreds of dollars a month 
 they make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip i know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you gets away with it not anymore weve written a build to stop it all its called the junk fee prevention act were going to ban surprise resort fees that hotels charge on your bill those fees can cost up to $90 a night at hotels that arent even resorts we
 idea that cable internet and cell phone companies can charge you 200 or more if you decide to switch another provider give me a break we can stop service fees on tickets to concerts and fees up front and charging $50 round trip for family just to be able to sit together bagage fees are bad enough airlines cant treat your child like
 a baggage americans are tired of being were tired of being played for suckers so pass past the junk free prevention act so companies stop ripping us off for too long workers have been getting stiffed but not anymore were getting were beginning to restore the dignity of work for example i i i should have known this but i didnt until two years ago
 30 million workers have to sign noncompete agreements with the jobs they take 30 million so a cashier at a burger place cant walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more it just change but they just changed it because we exposed it that was part of the deal guys look it up but not anymore were banning those agreements so companies have to compete for
 and pay them what theyre worth and i must tell you this is bound to get a response of my friends on my left but the right im so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing pass the proact because business have a right workers have a right to form a union
 lets guarantee all workers have a living wage lets make sure working parents can afford to raise the family with sick days paid family medical lead affordable child care thats going to enable millions and more people to go and stay at work and lets restore the full child tax credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half to
 the lowest level in history and by the way when we do all these things we increase productivity we increase economic growth so lets finish the job and get more families access to affordable quality housing lets get seniors want to stay in their homes they need to do so lets give more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the homec and services in need
 and support the workers who are doing gods work these plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them restoring the dignity
 work means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class when we made public education 12 years of at universal in the last century we made the best educated bestpaid we became the best educated bestpaid nation in the world but the rest of the worlds caught up its caught up jill my wife who teaches full time has an expression hope i get it right kid any nation that out educates us is going to outcompete us
 any nation out education can out compete us folks we all know 12 years of education is not enough to win the economic competition of 21st century you want to have the best educated workforce lets finish the job by providing access to preschool for three and four years old study show the children to go to preschool are nearly 50 more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two or fouryear degree no
 matter their background they came from lets get public school teachers a raise were making progress by reducing student debt increasing pell grants were working in middle class families lets finish the job and connect students to career opportunities starting in
 high school provide access to two years of community college the best career training in america in addition to being a pathway to a fouryear degree lets offer every american a path to a good car whether they go to college or not and folks folks in the midst of the covid crisis when schools were closed and we were shutting down everything lets re
 recognize how far we came in the fight against the pandemic itself while the virus is not gone thanks to resilience of the american people and the ingenuity of medicine we broken the covid grip on us covid deaths are down by 90 weve saved millions of lives and opened up our country we open our country back up and soon well end the public health emergency but thats called a public health emergency
 but well remember the toll and pain thats never going to go away more than a million americans lost their lives to covid a million families grieving children orphand empty chairs the dining room table constantly reminding you that she used to sit there remembering them we remain vigilant we still need to monitor dozens of variants and support
 vaccines and treatments so congress needs to f these efforts and keep america safe and as we emerge from this crisis stronger were also got a double down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses
 before i came to office you remember during that campaign the big issue was about inspector generals would protect tax their dollars or sideline they were fired many people said we dont need them and fraud became ramped last year i told you the watch dogs are back since then since then weve recovered billions of tax payers dollars now lets triple the antifraud strike 
 course going after these criminals double the statute limitations on these crimes and crack down an identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars billions of dollars from the american people and the data shows that for every dollar we put in the fighting fraud the tax get back at least 10 times as much it matters it matters look left his scars like the spikeing violent crime in
 2020 the first year of the pandemic we have an obligation to make sure all people are safe public safety depends on public trust as all of us know but too often that trust is violated join us tonight of the parents of tyri nichols welcome
 we had to bury tiri last week as many of you personally know theres no word
 to describe the heartaker brief of losing the child but imagine imagine if you lost that child at the hands of the law imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter came home from walking down the street playing in the park or just drive in a car most of us in here have never had to have the talk the talk that brown and black parents have had to have with their children bo hunter ashley my children
 i never had to have the talk with them i never had to tell them if a police officer pulls you over turn your interior lights on right away dont reach for your license keep your hands on the steering wheel imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car heres what tyris mother shared with me when i spoke to her when i ask her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out
 the faith of god she said her son was quote a beautiful soul and something good will come of this imagine how much courage and carry that takes its up to us to all of us we all want the same thing neighborhoods free of violence law enforcement of forcement who earns the communities trust just as every cop when they pin on that badge in the morning has a right to be able to
 home at night so does everybody else out there our children have a right to come home safely equal protection under the law is a covenant we have with each other and america we know police officers put their lives in the line every single night and day and we know we asked them in many cases to do too much to be
 counselors social workers psychologists responding to drug overdoses mental health crises and so much more in one sense we ask much too much of them i know most cops in their families are good decent honorable people the vast majority but they risk and they risk their lives every time the
 shield on but what happened to tyre and memphis happens too often we have to do better give law enforcement the real training they need hold them to higher standards help them succeed and keeping the safe we also need more first responders and professionals to address the growing mental health substance abuse challenges more resources reduce violent crime and gun crime more community intervention program
 more investment in housing education and job training all this can help prevent violence in the first place when police officers or police departments violate the public trust they must be held accountable with the support the support of the families of
 civil rights groups and law enforcement i signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokehols restricting no kock warrants and other key elements of the george floyd act lets commit ourselves to make the words of tylers mom true something good must come from this something good and all of us

 that we need to do lets come together to finish the job on police reform do something do something that was the plea of parents who lost their children yuvaldi i met with every one of them do something about gun violence thank god thank god we did passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades that includes things like
 that the majority of responsible gun owners already support enhanced background checks for 18 to 21 years old red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people are danger to themselves and others
